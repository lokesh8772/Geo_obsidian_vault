FAME India Scheme (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India)

### üóìÔ∏è **Launch Date**
Phase-I: 2015
Phase-II: April 1, 2019 (initially for 3 years, extended)

### üßë‚Äçüè´ **Ministry / Department**
Ministry of Heavy Industries

### üéØ **Objective**
To encourage the adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles (xEVs) by providing upfront incentives on purchase, thereby reducing vehicular emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. Aims to support the development of the EV manufacturing ecosystem and charging infrastructure in India.

### üë• **Target Beneficiaries**
- Buyers of electric two-wheelers, three-wheelers, four-wheelers, and buses.
- Manufacturers of electric and hybrid vehicles.
- Companies involved in setting up charging infrastructure.

### üí∞ **Features / Components / Assistance**
- **Demand Incentives:** Subsidies provided to buyers of eligible EVs, reducing the upfront purchase cost. The incentive amount varies based on vehicle type, battery capacity, and other specifications.
    - **Electric Two-Wheelers:** Incentive of ‚Çπ15,000 per kWh (initially ‚Çπ10,000/kWh) with a cap on the vehicle cost.
    - **Electric Three-Wheelers:** Incentives provided.
    - **Electric Four-Wheelers:** Incentives provided with a cap on ex-factory price. Initially included private vehicles, later focused on commercial use.
    - **Electric Buses:** Significant incentives for deployment in public transport.
- **Charging Infrastructure Support:** Financial assistance for setting up public charging stations across the country.
- **Support for R&D and Technology Development:** Initiatives to promote indigenous development and manufacturing of EVs and related components.

### üìç **Implementation Details**
- Implemented by the Ministry of Heavy Industries.
- Incentives are typically passed on to consumers by manufacturers at the time of purchase.
- The scheme has been implemented in phases:
    - **Phase-I (2015-2019):** Focused on demand creation, technology development, pilot projects, and charging infrastructure.
    - **Phase-II (April 1, 2019 - Extended):** Primarily focused on supporting the electrification of public and shared transportation and establishing charging infrastructure. Initially for 3 years with a budget of ‚Çπ10,000 crore, later increased to ‚Çπ11,500 crore and extended.
- A National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) provides the overall vision.

### üìà **Achievements / Data**
- **Phase-I:** Supported over 2.8 lakh EVs and sanctioned 520 charging stations.
- **Phase-II (as of December 31, 2024):**
    - Supported over 16.14 lakh EVs (14.28 lakh e-2Ws, 1.64 lakh e-3Ws, 22,548 e-4Ws).
    - Sanctioned over 6,800 electric buses for deployment.
    - Sanctioned over 2,800 charging stations.
- Significant reduction in CO2 emissions and fuel consumption.
- Increased awareness and adoption of electric vehicles in various segments.
- Encouraged domestic manufacturing of EVs and components.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Criticism / Challenges / Issues**
- Initial challenges in achieving widespread adoption across all vehicle segments.
- Dependence on government subsidies for EV affordability.
- Need for more rapid expansion of charging infrastructure, especially in smaller cities and highways.
- Ensuring the quality and safety of domestically manufactured EVs and batteries.
- Addressing concerns about the range anxiety of EV users.

### ‚úçÔ∏è **Recent Updates / Current Affairs Angle**
- **PM E-DRIVE Scheme (notified Sep 2024):** A 2-year scheme with ‚Çπ10,900 crore outlay to further support EVs and charging infrastructure.
- **PM e-Bus Sewa (notified Oct 2024):** Scheme to support the deployment of over 38,000 electric buses with a payment security mechanism.
- **Extension of FAME-II:** While initially for 3 years, Phase-II has been extended to further push EV adoption.
- **Increased Focus on Public Transport:** FAME-II has a strong emphasis on electrifying buses and three-wheelers for commercial use.
- **Push for Domestic Manufacturing:** Schemes like PLI for Auto and ACC batteries aim to strengthen the local EV ecosystem.
