### üóìÔ∏è **Launch Date**
October 21, 2016

### üßë‚Äçüè´ **Ministry / Department**
Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA)

### üéØ **Objective**
The UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) scheme is a regional airport development and Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) of the Government of India. Its objectives are:
- To make air travel affordable and accessible to the common man.
- To establish air connectivity to unserved and underserved airports across the country.
- To promote balanced regional growth and economic development.
- To revitalize underutilized and non-operational airports.
- To enhance overall air connectivity in the country.

### üë• **Target Beneficiaries**
Common citizens, especially in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities and remote regions, airlines, airport operators, and the local economies of connected regions.

### üí∞ **Features / Components / Assistance**
The UDAN scheme operates based on a market-driven approach with financial support:
- **Viability Gap Funding (VGF):** Financial support provided to airlines to cover the difference between the cost of operations and revenue on underserved routes, making fares affordable. The VGF is shared between the Central Government (50%) and State Governments (50%, except for NE states and UTs where it's 10%).
- **Capped Airfares:** Airfares on UDAN flights are capped at ‚Çπ2,500 per hour of flight for a certain number of seats (around 50% of the capacity).
- **Concessions:** Participating airlines, airports, and state governments offer various concessions to reduce the operational costs for airlines, including:
    - Reduced taxes on Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF).
    - Concessional GST on tickets.
    - No airport charges (landing, parking, storage).
    - Nil Terminal Navigation Landing Charges (TNLC).
    - Discounted Route Navigation and Facilitation Charges (RNFC).
    - Provision of land, security, and utilities at subsidized rates by State Governments.
- **Route Disbursal Mechanism:** Route allocation is spread equitably across five regions of the country to ensure balanced regional growth.
- **Phased Implementation:** The scheme has evolved through multiple phases (UDAN 1.0 to UDAN 5.0 and beyond), each focusing on expanding connectivity to more remote areas, including helipads and water aerodromes, and revising the operational framework based on learnings.

### üìç **Implementation Details**
- The Airports Authority of India (AAI) is the nodal agency responsible for implementing the UDAN scheme.
- Airlines bid for routes based on their assessment of demand.
- The government provides VGF for a period of three years per route to the selected airlines.
- A Regional Connectivity Fund (RCF) has been created to finance the VGF through a levy on certain domestic flights.
- The scheme is monitored at various levels by the Ministry of Civil Aviation and AAI.

### üìà **Achievements / Data** (As of April 2025)
- Over **625 UDAN routes** have been operationalized.
- **90 airports** (including 2 water aerodromes and 15 heliports) have been connected.
- More than **1.49 crore passengers** have benefited from affordable regional air travel.
- India's airport network has expanded from **74 airports in 2014 to 159 airports in 2024**.
- UDAN has connected **34 States/UTs** across the country.
- Over **479 new routes** have been introduced.
- Several previously unserved/underserved airports have been revived and are now operational (e.g., Jharsuguda, Kishangarh, Darbhanga, Hubli, Kannur, Mysore).
- The scheme has boosted tourism and economic activity in connected regions.

### üß© **Linkages / Related Schemes**
- **[[National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP) 2016]]:** UDAN is a key component of NCAP 2016.
- **Krishi UDAN:** Aims to improve value realization for agri-produce by facilitating their transportation through air logistics, especially from the Northeast, hilly, and tribal regions, often utilizing UDAN airports.
- **Lifeline UDAN:** Launched during the COVID-19 pandemic to transport essential medical cargo to remote areas, utilizing the UDAN network.
- **[[PM GatiShakti]]:** UDAN contributes to the overall goal of multi-modal connectivity by enhancing air linkages to various regions.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Criticism / Challenges / Issues**
- **Commercial Viability:** Some routes have struggled with low passenger load factors, making them commercially unsustainable for airlines even with VGF.
- **Infrastructure Gaps:** Many regional airports require significant upgrades to handle increased air traffic.
- **Operational Delays:** Execution of airport development projects has sometimes been slow.
- **Financial Sustainability:** Ensuring the long-term financial viability of UDAN routes and the RCF.
- **Coordination:** Effective coordination between the Central Government, State Governments, and various airport operators is crucial but can face challenges.

### ‚úçÔ∏è **Recent Updates / Current Affairs Angle**
- The **revamped UDAN initiative** aims to add 120 new destinations and enable affordable air travel for 4 crore more passengers over the next decade, focusing on remote, hilly, and aspirational districts, especially in the North Eastern region.
- **UDAN 5.0 and 5.1** have focused on longer routes, helicopter connectivity, and revised financial support frameworks to attract more airlines.
- The **Union Budget 2025-26** is expected to further enhance regional connectivity through a modified UDAN scheme.
- Emphasis on connecting tourism routes and water aerodromes to boost tourism.
