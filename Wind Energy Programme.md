### 🗓️ **Launch Date**
Began in 1983-84. The National Wind Energy Mission was proposed in the Twelfth Five Year Plan (around 2012-2017).

### 🧑‍🏫 **Ministry / Department**
Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE)

### 🎯 **Objective**
To promote wind power generation for energy security, economic development, climate change mitigation, rural development, and employment generation. Aims to harness India's significant wind energy potential both onshore and offshore. The target was set at 60 GW of installed wind power capacity by 2022, and a broader renewable energy target of 500 GW by 2030 includes 140 GW from wind.

### 👥 **Target Beneficiaries**
- Private sector investors
- Independent Power Producers (IPPs)
- Electricity distribution companies (DISCOMs)
- Large electricity consumers (through Renewable Purchase Obligations)

### 💰 **Features / Components / Assistance**
- **Fiscal and Financial Incentives:** Accelerated Depreciation benefits, concessional custom duty exemptions on certain components.
- **Generation Based Incentive (GBI):** Scheme available for projects commissioned before March 31, 2017 (now discontinued but relevant for past projects).
- **Tariff Based Competitive Bidding:** Guidelines for procurement of power from grid-connected wind power projects through transparent bidding to achieve competitive tariffs.
- **Waiver of Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) Charges:** For inter-state sale of solar and wind power for projects commissioned by June 30, 2025.
- **Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO):** Mandates a certain percentage of electricity procurement from renewable sources for DISCOMs and large consumers.
- **Viability Gap Funding (VGF):** Financial support for offshore wind energy projects to bridge cost gaps.
- **Repowering Policy:** Guidelines to replace old and less efficient wind turbines with advanced ones.

### 📍 **Implementation Details**
- Implemented by MNRE.
- Technical support including wind resource assessment provided by the National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE), Chennai.
- Wind resource assessment program identifies potential sites using wind monitoring stations and wind potential maps.
- Market-oriented strategy encouraging private sector involvement rather than direct government execution.
- Offshore wind energy development is being facilitated through the National Offshore Wind Energy Policy (2015).

### 📈 **Achievements / Data**
- India has the fourth-highest wind installed capacity globally.
- Total installed wind power capacity reached 50.00 GW as of March 31, 2025.
- Wind power accounts for nearly 10% of India's total installed utility power generation capacity.
- Generated 71.814 TWh in FY 2022-23, about 4.43% of total electricity generation.
- Onshore wind power potential estimated at 695 GW at 120m above ground level.
- Offshore wind potential estimated at about 70 GW off the coasts of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.

- National Solar Mission (NSM)
- National Green Hydrogen Mission
- National Wind-Solar Hybrid Policy
- Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) mechanisms
- Schemes promoting domestic manufacturing in the renewable energy sector.

### ⚠️ **Criticism / Challenges / Issues**
- Shift to competitive bidding has reduced profitability for some projects.
- Intermittency of wind power requires grid stabilization measures and integration with other sources like solar.
- Land availability in high-wind potential areas can be a constraint.
- Impact on bird and bat populations needs mitigation.
- Decommissioning and recycling of old wind turbine blades are emerging challenges.
- Ensuring RPO compliance by all states.
- Addressing payment delays from DISCOMs to wind energy developers.

### ✍️ **Recent Updates / Current Affairs Angle**
- Focus on achieving the target of 140 GW wind capacity by 2030 as part of the 500 GW renewable energy goal.
- Emphasis on developing offshore wind energy potential with VGF support for initial projects in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.
- Promotion of wind-solar hybrid projects for better grid stability and resource utilization.
- Policy focus on repowering old wind farms to enhance efficiency.
- Continued wind resource assessment studies at higher hub heights (e.g., 150m).
