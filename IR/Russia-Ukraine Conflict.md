1. Started
   - February 24, 2022: Russia launches full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
   - Roots in 2014: Russian annexation of [[Crimea]] and support for separatists in Donbas, leading to ongoing low-intensity conflict.

2. Reason
   - Ukraine view: Russian aggression to prevent Ukraine's NATO/EU integration, violating sovereignty and territorial integrity; response to 2014 Revolution of Dignity ousting pro-Russian leader.
   - Russia view: To "demilitarize and denazify" Ukraine, protect Russian-speaking populations in Donbas, counter NATO expansion seen as security threat.

3. Chronology and major developments
   - 2014: Annexation of Crimea; separatist war in Donbas with Russian-backed DPR/LPR.
   - Feb-Apr 2022: Invasion targets Kyiv; Russian advances stalled, retreat from north.
   - May 2022: Fall of Mariupol after siege.
   - Sep-Nov 2022: Ukrainian counteroffensives reclaim Kharkiv and parts of Kherson.
   - May 2023: Russia captures Bakhmut after prolonged battle.
   - Jun 2023: Kakhovka Dam destruction floods southern Ukraine.
   - Feb 2024: Russia takes Avdiivka.
   - May 2024: Russian offensive in Kharkiv region.
   - Aug 2024: Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk region.

4. Features
   - Russian artillery and missile barrages: Intensive long-range strikes to weaken defenses, e.g., bombardment during the Siege of Mariupol (2022).
   - Russian drone swarms: Mass deployment for reconnaissance and attacks, e.g., Shahed drone barrages on Ukrainian infrastructure (ongoing since 2022).
   - Russian infiltration tactics: Small groups advancing under drone and artillery cover, e.g., gradual advances in Donetsk region (2024-2025).
   - Russian scorched-earth tactics: Destroying areas to deny resources, e.g., retreat from Kyiv region with widespread destruction (2022).
   - Ukrainian asymmetric drone strikes: Precision attacks on high-value targets, e.g., Operation Spider's Web targeting Russian air bases (June 2025).
   - Ukrainian naval drone operations: Surface drones for Black Sea strikes, e.g., attacks on Russian Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol (2022-2023).
   - Ukrainian defensive attrition: Wearing down Russian forces through guerrilla tactics, e.g., Kursk incursion (August 2024).
   - Ukrainian robotic assaults: All-robot attacks with machine-gun mounted vehicles, e.g., first deployment in Donbas (December 2024).

5. Effects (cross-sectoral)
   - Humanitarian: Over 500,000 casualties; 6 million refugees; widespread destruction of infrastructure.
   - Economic: Global inflation, food/energy crises; sanctions cripple Russian economy (worker shortages, ruble decline); Ukraine's GDP down 30%.
   - Environmental: Massive pollution from warfare, including air/water contamination and nuclear risks.
   - Geopolitical: Strengthened NATO unity; energy shifts away from Russia; rise in global arms spending and alliances like BRICS challenges.

6. Recent developments
   - Aug 2025: Russian breakthroughs near Pokrovsk in Donetsk; Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian facilities; Zelenskyy rejects territorial concessions.
   - Ongoing: Stalemate with attrition warfare; US-proposed talks with Russia; UN warnings on sexual violence patterns.
