1. Started
   - Roots in early 20th century: competing national movements (Zionist and Palestinian Arab), British Mandate policies, and the 1947 UN Partition Plan.  
   - 1948: First Arab–Israeli war; State of Israel established; Palestinian Nakba with mass displacement.  
   - 1967: Six-Day War; Israel occupies West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem—triggering protracted occupation dynamics.  
   - 2000s: Second Intifada, Gaza disengagement (2005), Hamas–Fatah split (2007).  
   - 2023–present: Israel–Hamas war begins after Hamas’ October 7 attacks and mass hostage-taking; extensive Israeli operations in Gaza follow.  

1. Reason
   - Palestine view: Self-determination, end to occupation and settlements, right of return/refugee redress, East Jerusalem as capital of a sovereign state; ending blockade of Gaza and addressing humanitarian crises.  
   - Israel view: Security from terrorism and rocket attacks, demilitarization of hostile groups (Hamas/PIJ), recognition as a Jewish state, prevention of weapons smuggling, and ensuring defensible borders including control over key security corridors.  

3. Chronology and major developments
   - 1947–49: UN Partition Plan; 1948 war; armistice lines (Green Line).  
   - 1967–73: Six-Day War; Yom Kippur War; UNSC Resolution 242 (land-for-peace framework).  
   - 1993–2000: Oslo Accords (PA created), mutual recognition, partial withdrawals; Camp David/Taba talks falter.  
   - 2005–07: Gaza disengagement; Hamas electoral win (2006) and Gaza takeover (2007); blockade era begins.  
   - 2008–21: Repeated Gaza escalations (Cast Lead, Pillar of Defense, Protective Edge, Guardian of the Walls).  
   - 2023–25: Oct 7 Hamas attack; large-scale Israeli operations, urban warfare in Gaza, brief ceasefire and hostage–prisoner exchanges (early 2025), resumption of hostilities and expanded raids; regional spillovers involving Hezbollah and Red Sea tensions.  

4. Features
   - Rocket and missile warfare: Large volumes of short- and medium-range rockets from Gaza; Israeli multilayered air defense (Iron Dome, David’s Sling, Arrow); precision strikes on launch sites and command nodes.  
   - Tunnel-centric urban combat: Extensive Hamas tunnel networks (“metro”) enabling maneuver, ambush, and logistics; IDF employs bunker-busting munitions, robotics, and engineering breaching teams.  
   - Hostage and negotiation dynamics: Mass hostage-taking on Oct 7; periodic exchanges tied to temporary pauses; intelligence-led special operations for rescues.  
   - Siege and blockade measures: Movement and goods restrictions, border control, and corridor creation (e.g., Netzarim/Philadelphi) to interdict arms and isolate combat zones.  
   - Information and cyber operations: Narrative warfare, OSINT-driven targeting, EW against drones/comms; disinformation battles shaping international opinion.  
   - UAV/loitering munitions: ISR and strike drones by both sides; Israeli precision targeting; Palestinian kamikaze drones against armor and outposts.  
   - Regional proxy escalation: Cross-border rocket/artillery with Hezbollah, Red Sea disruption linked to allied groups, and periodic Iran–Israel strike exchanges.  

5. Effects (cross-sectoral)
   - Humanitarian: Large-scale civilian casualties and displacement in Gaza; severe food insecurity, healthcare collapse, and infrastructure damage; trauma and displacement in Israeli border communities.  
   - Economic: Gaza devastation; Israeli economic slowdown in tourism/tech during mobilizations; global energy/shipping disruptions via Red Sea; donor fatigue strains aid systems.  
   - Political–legal: ICC/ICJ scrutiny; UN debates on ceasefires and accountability; polarization within Israeli and Palestinian politics; governance vacuum risks in Gaza.  
   - Regional–global: Heightened Israel–Iran and Israel–Hezbollah tensions; U.S., Egypt, Qatar mediation roles; shifting Arab normalization calculus; campus and diaspora polarization internationally.  
   - Security: Urban combat lessons, air defense saturation, tunnel countermeasures, hostage crisis management, and civil defense/hardened infrastructure practices.  

6. Recent developments
   - Early–mid 2025: Brief ceasefire with phased hostage–prisoner exchanges and partial withdrawals; talks stall; hostilities resume with renewed Israeli operations and corridor control.  
   - 2025: IDF deep raids and targeted strikes in Gaza; continued Hezbollah–Israel exchanges; intensified humanitarian crisis indicators and expanded aid coordination attempts; domestic protests in Israel over war aims and hostages; diplomatic pushes for sustained ceasefire and governance arrangements post-conflict.
