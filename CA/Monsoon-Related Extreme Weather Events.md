### changing nature of monsoon 
1. Distorted Co-relation between El-Nino and reduced rainfall in india -> due to changes in Global Atmospheric Circulation Patterns
2. Global warming -> vapour carrying capacity of clouds -> increased -> high intensity rainfall
3. monsoonal winds weaker but increased temp -> increased atmospheric humidity -> Intense rainfall events separated by dry spells
4. Change in rainfall distribution -> drier areas are becoming wetter and wetter areas are becoming drier
	1. Reduced rainfall in ganga basin while increased rainfall in gujrat Suarashtra and Rajasthan

### Impacts :
1. Disaster management challenges -> frequent extreme events
2. Weather Forecast challenges -> due to distorted relationship between well-established climate phenomena with indian monsoon (El-Nino - reduced rain) -> hinders preparedness
3. Monsoon affects 51% of farmed area which accounts for 40% of total agricultural production, 47% of population dependent on agriculture for livelihood
