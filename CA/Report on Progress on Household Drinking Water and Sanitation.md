1. By [[WHO]] and [[UNICEF]]
2. report focused on inequalities in access to Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)[[UNICEF]]
# Key Highlights
1. open defecation -> low income countries -> 4 x global avg.
2. access to safe sanitation -> 58%
3. safely managed drinking water -> 68% in 2015 -> 74% in 2024
4. gendered burden -> women spend more time fetching water
5. Menstrual cycle -> 70 countries showed wide gaps across all income levels
## India specific
1. significant progress in open defecation but still marginalized and rural area uncovered.
2. Sanitation access -> near universal access to basic sanitation but slippage in use, and maintenance remains challenges
3. Drinking water -> expanded household tap water connections but **safely managed drinking water** remains **below universal levels**.
4. equity issues -> marginalized groups lack in access ....
