Recently SC declared forced narco tests as violative of the FRs under Art 20(3) and art 21.
### Narco test
person is intoxicated with a drug(sodium Pentothal) in controlled concentration to lose reasoning abilities, and then interrogated.
SC -> 
1. narco test can not be the sole basis of conviction
2. there is no right to undergo narco test
