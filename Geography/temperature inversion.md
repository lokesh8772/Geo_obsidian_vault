in clear sky nights the hilly areas looses heat by radiation very fast -> now the air in contact with the hilly areas cool down => this air descend to the valley -> replacing the warmer air -> now temp increases as we move upward.

### fog formation
1. colder air in the valleys -> have less capacity to hold humidity
2. condensation takes place
3. fog formation
4. as the system is stable, -> this last longer, (sunlight have lesser effect due to presence of warmer airmass in between(that absorbs the ))
