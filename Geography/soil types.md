| **1. Alluvial Soil**                               | Formed by the deposition of silt, sand, and clay carried by rivers (Indus, Ganga, Brahmaputra) and coastal waves. Also includes deltaic alluvium.  | - **Texture:** Loamy to sandy loam, sometimes silty or clayey.  <br>- **Color:** Light gray to ash gray.  <br>- **Fertility:** Highly fertile.  <br>- **Structure:** Well-drained, porous.                                                                                      | Northern Plains (Punjab, Haryana, UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam), parts of Gujarat, Rajasthan, coastal plains of peninsular India (river deltas). | Rich in Potash, Phosphoric Acid, and Lime.

| **2. Black Soil** (Regur Soil / Black Cotton Soil) | Formed from weathered basaltic lava rocks (Deccan Trap formation) and solidification of lava flows.                                                | - **Texture:** Clayey, fine-grained.  <br>- **Color:** Black to deep black.  <br>- **Fertility:** Self-ploughing (cracks during dry season).  <br>- **Structure:** High moisture retention capacity (swells when wet, shrinks when dry).                                        | Deccan Plateau (Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, parts of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu).                                            | Rich in Iron, Lime, Aluminum, Magnesium, and Potash.

| **3. Red Soil**                                    | Formed from the weathering of old crystalline and metamorphic rocks (granite, gneiss) under moderate rainfall.                                     | - **Texture:** Sandy to loamy, often coarse.  <br>- **Color:** Reddish (due to high iron content in crystalline form).
