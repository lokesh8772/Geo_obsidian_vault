### types
1. abrasion - wind ladened with sand particles erode the surface of rocks by hitting against its walls
2. attrition - erosion of sand particles while they are being transported by wind
3. Deflation - removing and carrying away of dry, unsorted dust particles by moving wind

### landforms

| landforms      | characteristics                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| mushroom rocks | mushroom shaped rocks                                                                            |
| demoiselles    | column like structure, cap of harder rocks-> lower part of softer rocks                          |
| Zeugen         | a table like structure in a plane, with upper part of harder rock and lower part of softer rocks |
| yardang        | shape - inverted boat -> parallel to wind direction                                              |
| inselberg      | isolated mountain -> rocks rising abruptly in a plain                                            |

mesa and butte - after erosion of a plateau -> wider than height, flat topped.
