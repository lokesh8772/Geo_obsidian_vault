### hadley cell 
1. equator - 30 deg.
2. air ascent at equator and descent at 30 deg due to accumulation and cooling
### ferrel cell 
1. sub tropical westerlies - ascent after reaching 60 deg
2. polar cold winds -> descend at 30 deg ?
3. this cell is not driven by temp differences -> then ? -> acts as a gear for other two cells
### polar cell
1. polar easterlies,
2. at the poles air descend
3. around 60 deg air ascend due to convergence with the westerlies of ferrel cell
