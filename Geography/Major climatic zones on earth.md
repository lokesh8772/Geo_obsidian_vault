## Major Climatic Zones of Earth

|Climate Zone|Location/Latitude|Insolation (Average W/m²)|Temperature Range (Avg. °C)|Relative Humidity (Avg. %)|Rainfall (Annual Avg. mm)|Dominant Vegetation|Other Significant Info|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**1. Tropical Wet (Equatorial/Rainforest)**|0° - 10° N/S of Equator|High (180-200 W/m²)|High, consistent (20-30°C); little seasonal variation|High (75-90%)|Very High (2000-4000+ mm)|Tropical Rainforest (dense, evergreen, broadleaf, high biodiversity)|Constant heat and humidity; daily convectional rainfall; high biodiversity; Doldrums (low pressure)|
|**2. Tropical Wet & Dry (Savanna)**|10° - 20° N/S of Equator|High (170-190 W/m²)|High (20-30°C); distinct wet & dry seasons|Moderate (50-70% dry, 70-85% wet)|Moderate (750-1500 mm)|Grasslands with scattered trees (acacia, baobab); adaptations to drought|Influenced by ITCZ migration; known for large animal migrations; Trade Winds|
|**3. Hot Desert (Arid)**|20° - 30° N/S (Subtropical High Pressure belts)|Very High (280-320 W/m²); High daytime, very low nighttime|Very high daytime (30-45+°C); large diurnal range; can drop below 0°C at night|Very Low (10-30%)|Very Low (<250 mm)|Sparse, xerophytic vegetation (cacti, succulents, short grasses)|Extreme temperature fluctuations; very low humidity; clear skies; often on western continental margins due to offshore trade winds|
|**4. Cold Desert (Arid)**|Mid-latitudes, continental interiors (e.g., Gobi)|Moderate (150-250 W/m²)|Hot summers (20-35°C), very cold winters (below 0°C, often -10 to -20°C)|Low (20-40%)|Very Low (<250 mm), often snow in winter|Sparse shrubs, grasses; some cold-hardy plants|Large annual temperature range; far from oceanic influence; rain shadow effect|
|**5. Mediterranean (Warm Temperate Western Margin)**|30° - 45° N/S (Western sides of continents)|Moderate-High (150-250 W/m²)|Warm/Hot, dry summers (20-30°C); Mild, wet winters (5-15°C)|Moderate (40-70%)|Moderate (300-900 mm), mostly in winter|Sclerophyllous vegetation (chaparral, maquis, olive, citrus, vineyards)|Distinct dry summer due to subtropical high extension; favored for agriculture|
|**6. Humid Subtropical (Warm Temperate Eastern Margin)**|25° - 40° N/S (Eastern sides of continents)|Moderate-High (150-250 W/m²)|Hot, humid summers (25-30°C); Mild to cool winters (5-15°C)|High (60-80%)|High (800-1650 mm), year-round with summer peak|Mixed forests (deciduous & evergreen), pine forests; lush growth|Influenced by warm ocean currents & moist tropical air; subject to tropical cyclones|
|**7. Marine West Coast (Temperate Oceanic)**|40° - 65° N/S (Western coasts of continents)|Moderate (100-200 W/m²)|Mild summers (15-20°C); Mild winters (0-10°C); small annual range|High (70-90%)|High (750-2000+ mm), well distributed year-round|Temperate rainforests, coniferous forests (spruce, fir, redwood)|Strong oceanic influence moderates temperatures; frequent cloud cover, fog, drizzle|
|**8. Humid Continental (Cool Temperate)**|40° - 60° N (Interior of continents, Northern Hemisphere)|Moderate (100-200 W/m²)|Warm/Hot summers (20-30°C); Cold/Very Cold winters (-10 to -25°C or lower)|Moderate (50-70%)|Moderate (500-1200 mm), summer maximum|Deciduous forests, mixed forests, grasslands (prairie/steppe)|Large annual temperature range; distinct four seasons; snow cover common in winter|
|**9. Subarctic (Taiga/Boreal Forest)**|50° - 70° N (High latitudes, Northern Hemisphere)|Low-Moderate (70-150 W/m²)|Short, cool summers (10-20°C); Long, extremely cold winters (-30 to -50°C)|Moderate (60-80%)|Low (250-500 mm), mostly summer rain/snow|Coniferous forests (spruce, pine, fir); permafrost in some areas|Extreme temperature range; short growing season; vast continuous forest biome|
|**10. Tundra**|60° - 75° N (Polar regions, adjacent to ice caps)|Low (50-100 W/m²)|Cool summers (0-10°C); Very cold winters (-20 to -40°C)|Moderate-High (70-90%)|Very Low (150-250 mm), mostly snow|Low-growing plants (mosses, lichens, dwarf shrubs, sedges); no trees|Permafrost dominates; short growing season; boggy conditions in summer|
|**11. Ice Cap (Polar)**|>75° N/S (Antarctica, Greenland interiors)|Very Low (<50 W/m²); Zero for significant periods|Extremely Cold (Avg. below 0°C, often -30 to -60°C; never above 0°C)|Very Low (due to cold, dry air)|Very Low (<150 mm), all snow/ice|Virtually none; some algae/lichens near coasts|Permanent ice and snow cover; Earth's coldest and driest regions; polar highs|
|**12. Highland/Mountain**|Varies by altitude and specific mountain range|Varies greatly with altitude, slope aspect|Decreases with altitude (lapse rate approx. 6.5°C/1000m); large diurnal variation|Varies; can be very low at high altitudes, higher in valleys|Varies greatly (orographic precipitation on windward sides, rain shadow on leeward)|Altitudinal zonation (forests, grasslands, tundra, permanent snow/ice)|Highly localized climates due to elevation, aspect, and terrain; temperature inversions common in valleys|
