### reason
1. movement of earth -> rotation on its axis.
2. different points on earth -> different velocities -> air/ocean current/ projectile when crosses lattitudes -> the difference between the earth's tangential speed and tangential component of the object's velocity, changes -> on the spherical map, the object seems to be deflected from its path
3. in northern hemisphere - rightward deflection
4. in southern -> leftward deflection
### imp 
1. if the object or wind move along a single lattitude it will not get deflected due to coriolis force.
2. max at poles and minimum (zero) at equator.
	1. reason -> at equator the tangential velocity of the object and the earth are in same direction as here lattitudes are parallel to the direction(east-> west)
	2. as we move poleward -> lattitudes start bending, so earth's tangential speed at different points along a single lattitude would have different directions -> an object having an initial direction in the tangential direction will be actually crossing the lattitudes upon movement, we would observe this as bending of the path on the map,
	3. any object get their revolutionary motion due to g, in case of equator, g will facilitate the trajectrory more or less, but in case of poleward -> g will make the object complete a circle along its perimeter(diameter) -> cross the latti
