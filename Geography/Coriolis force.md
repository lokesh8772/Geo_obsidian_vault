### reason
1. movement of earth -> rotation on its axis.
2. different points on earth -> different velocities -> air/ocean current/ projectile when crosses lattitudes -> the difference between the earth's tangential speed and tangential component of the object's velocity, changes -> on the spherical map, the object seems to be deflected from its path
3. in northern hemisphere - rightward deflection
4. in southern -> leftward deflection
### imp 
1. if the object or wind move along a single lattitude it will not get deflected due to coriolis force.
2. max at poles and minimum (zero) at equator.
	1. reason(?) -> both sides of equator deflect the object in opposite direction -> the net perceived deflection might be zero.
	2. at poles
