## Theories For Earth
1. Nebular Hypothesis -> 
	1. by Immanual Kant, and Laplace
	2. Earth/Planets was formed by a cloud of dust revolving around the sun
2. Chamberlain and Moultan 
	1. a wandering star approached the sun, as a result, a cigar shaped extention of mass from the sun happened and separated -> got divided in the form of planets
3. Binary theories 
	1. believes existence of a companion to the Sun, 
4. Otto Schmitz and Carl Weizasker -> 
	1. revised the Nebular Hypothesis
	2. said the earlier cloud was made up of Mostly Hydrogen and helium
	3. Friction and collision of particles -> disk shape
	4. Formation of Planets -> **Accretion**

## Origin of the Universe
1. Big Bang(13.7 billion Yrs ago)
2. Earlier few Fractions of second -> expansion was fast -> later slowed down
3. Energy -> Mass, < 3 Min -> first atom
4. 3,00,000 yrs -> universe cooled down to 4500 K -> Atomic matter dominant -> Universe became transparent
5. non-uniform distribution of mass -> concentration(gravitational force) -> Formation of Galaxy
6. Galaxy
	1. Large clouds of H2 -> Nebula
	2. Diameter -> 80 - 150 K light Yrs
7. Formation of stars -> 5-6 billion yrs ago
	1. localized lumps of gases -> accumulation/concentration by Gravitational force 
	2. Core + rotating disc of gases
		1. disc of gases -> condensation -> small round objects(Plaentesimals) -> Accretion -> Planets

## Evolution of Earth
1. Atmosphere
	1. Premordial Atm -> 
		1. Thin layer of H2 and He
		2. stripped off by Solar winds(also for all the other planets)
	2. Cooling -> Volcanoes -> Degassing(gases out of the interior of earth)
		1. $\ce{H2O}$, $\ce{N2}$, $\ce{CO2}$, $\ce{CH4}$, $\ce{NH3}$  , little amounts of $\ce{O2}$
		2. $\ce{H2O}$ condensed -> $\ce{CO2}$ dissolved -> more cooling
2. Structure 
	1. Gravity -> Density(increase), -> increase in Temp -> Heavier Materials ↡  and Lighter material ↟(**differentiation**)
	2. Cooled and Condensed to Smaller size
	3. Giant impact causing Moon Formation -> Heating ..... -> Cooling...
		1. large amount of debris -> revolving around Earth -> accretion -> Moon
