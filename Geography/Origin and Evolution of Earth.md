## Theories For Earth
1. Nebular Hypothesis ->

	2. Earth/Planets was formed by a cloud of dust revolving around the sun
2. Chamberlain and Moultan 
	1. a wandering star approached the sun, as a result, a cigar shaped extention of mass from the sun happened and separated -> got divided in the form of planets
3. Binary theories 
	1. believes existence of a companion to the Sun, 
4. Otto Schmitz and Carl Weizasker -> 
	1. revised the Nebular Hypothesis
	2. said the earlier cloud was made up of Mostly Hydrogen and helium
	3. Friction and collision of particles -> disk shape
	4. Formation of Planets -> **Accretion**

## Origin of the Universe
1. Big Bang(13.7 billion Yrs ago)
2. Earlier few Fractions of second -> expansion was fast -> later slowed down
3. Energy -> Mass, < 3 Min -> first atom
4. 3,00,000 yrs -> universe cooled dow
5. non-uniform distribution of mass -> concentration(gravitational force) -> Formation of Stars(5-6 Billion yrs ago)
