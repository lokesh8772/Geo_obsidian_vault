1. hypocenter - where the energy get released
2. epicenter - the nearest point on surface to the hypocenter
3. P-wave -primary -> first to arrive -> like sound waves-> can move through any medium
4. S-Wave  - secondary -> arrive after lag -> lattitudinal waves -> can move only in solid medium

s-wave shadowzone - 103 degree
P-wave - can move in solid and liquid -> outer core - path deviate -> shadow zone - 103 - 142
surface waves 
	rayleigh waves
	love waves - most destrutive
### magnitude
amount of energy released at the epicenter, 
Richter scale 
logrithmic scale

### intensity
1. the shaking xp felt at a particular location
2. mercalli scale.
3.
