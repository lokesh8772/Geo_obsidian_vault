general term for all types of exogenic geomorphic processes
### weathering
1. physical disintegration or chemical decomposition
#### types - 
1. chemical - 
	1. carbonation - reaction of minerals with carbonates or bicarbonates -> CO2 + water -> weak acid ....
	2. hydration- water acquired by minerals -> size expands -> fatigue -> dis-integrate
2. biological -
	1. earthworms, rodents
	2. human actitvites like ploughing... expose new surfaces to weathering(all types)
	3. animal waste degradation -> humic and carbonic acid -> weathering
	4. plant roots -> breaking of rocks
3. physical weathering
	1. water pressure
	2. temp change, pressure change
	3. gravitational forces
#### exfoliation - 
due to dirurnal changes in temp. -> expansion and contraction.
#### salt weathering
salt expands due to temp, hydration and cystallization ... -> weathering

### erosion- 
is physical removal and transportation of weathered matter by wind, ice, water...
