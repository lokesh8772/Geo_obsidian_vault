| peneplane     | an undulating, featureless plane with low lying residual hills, generally considered an end product of erosional cycle. |
| Dendritic     | irregular tree branch shaped,[[Indus]], [[Godavari]],[[Mahanadi]],[[Cauvery]],[[Krishna]]                               |
| Trellis       | subsequent streams meet the main stream at right angles, ex - Seine(france)                                             |
| Angular       | tributaries meet the main stream at acute angles - ex - himalayan foothils rivers                                       |
| Parallel      | rivers seems to be running in parallel to each other ex - rivers of lesser himalayas                                    |
| Radial        | rivers seems to diverge radially from a central origin place -> rivers of saurashtra region, kilimanjaro...             |
| Centripetal   | rivers seems to converge in a central region. ex - rivers of tibet, laddakh and baghmati                                |
| alluvial fans |                                                                                                                         |
