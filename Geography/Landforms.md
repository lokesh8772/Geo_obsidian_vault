| peneplane          | an undulating, featureless plane with low lying residual hills, generally considered an end product of erosional cycle.                                                                       |
| Dendritic          | irregular tree branch shaped,[[Indus]], [[Godavari]],[[Mahanadi]],[[Cauvery]],[[Krishna]]                                                                                                     |
| Trellis            | subsequent streams meet the main stream at right angles, ex - Seine(france)                                                                                                                   |
| Angular            | tributaries meet the main stream at acute angles - ex - himalayan foothils rivers                                                                                                             |
| Parallel           | rivers seems to be running in parallel to each other ex - rivers of lesser himalayas                                                                                                          |
| Radial             | rivers seems to diverge radially from a central origin place -> rivers of saurashtra region, kilimanjaro...                                                                                   |
| Centripetal        | rivers seems to converge in a central region. ex - rivers of tibet, laddakh and baghmati                                                                                                      |

| delta              | deposition of sediments, less speed of flow, highly fertile land,                                                                                                                             |
| estuary            | a water body partially enclosed by landforms or geography of the beach, -> mixing of fresh and saline water, highly productive ecotone(nurseries of the sea), minimal deposition of sediments |
| wave-cut plateform | waves hit the cliff -> make the surface plane                                                                                                                                                 |
| sea cliff          | a shoreline having steep slope                                                                                                                                                                |
| sea arch           | differential erosion of a sea cliff by waves from opposite sides -> bridge like structure.                                                                                                    |
