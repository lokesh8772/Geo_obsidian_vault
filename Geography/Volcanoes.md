### island arcs
1. oceanic - convergence of oceanic plates -> 
	1. japan archi. -> pacific + Okhotsk plate(part of North american plate)
2. continental - convergence of oceanic and continental plates.
	1. phillippine arc -> sunda plate(eurasian) + phillippines plate
	2. indonesian arc - sunda + indo-australian
### lava types
1. acidic -
	1. highly viscous
	2. light colored
	3. low density
	4. generally form steep sided cone
2. basic - 
	1. less viscous
	2. dark colored
	3. higher density
	4. hottest lavas(1000 C)
### hotspot volcano
1. not at plate margins but in the interior of the plates
2. Ex - yellowstone, hawaii, reunion
3. formed due to mantle plumes -> exceptionally hot areas fixed in the mantle
4. heat rises through convection -> crust melts-> magma moves upwards
### composite volcano
1. steep slope
2. acidic lava
3. cone of alternate layers of lava and ashes
4. formed due to alternate fissure(lava) and explosive eruption(ashes/cinder)
### shield volcano
1. highest of all
2. largest of all
3. basaltic lava

### cinder cone
1. smallest of all
2. basaltic lava
3. more explosive than fissure eruptions but less than ...stromboli...
4. basaltic lava -> splits into globules into the air during eruption -> solidifies -> cinder....

### **Table: Important Volcanoes for UPSC Exams**

| Volcano Name          | Location                | Explosiveness (VEI*)                 | Activeness                                         | Type of Cone/Volcano                           | Key Facts / Significance                                                                                              |

| **Krakatoa**          | Sunda Strait, Indonesia | Extremely High (VEI 6 in 1883)       | Active (Child cone "Anak Krakatau" is very active) | Stratovolcano (island volcano)                 | Catastrophic 1883 eruption, one of the loudest sounds ever heard, caused global tsunamis and climate cooling.         |
| **Mount Fuji**        | Honshu Island, Japan    | Moderate to High                     | Active (Dormant since 1707)                        | Stratovolcano (Composite)                      | Japan's highest peak, iconic symbol. Last erupted in 1707.                                                            |
| **Mount St. Helens**  | Washington, USA         | High (VEI 5 in 1980)                 | Active                                             | Stratovolcano (Composite)                      | Major eruption in 1980, known for its lateral blast and debris avalanche.                                             |

Characterized by gentle, effusive lava flows.                               |
| **Mount Etna**        | Sicily, Italy           | Mixed (Effusive & Explosive)         | Highly Active (Almost continuous activity)         | Stratovolcano (Complex)                        | Europe's most active volcano. Exhibits varied eruptive styles, from gentle lava flows to explosive eruptions.         |
| **Stromboli**         | Aeolian Islands, Italy  | Low to Moderate                      | Highly Active (Almost continuous activity)         | Stratovolcano (Island volcano)                 | Known as the "Lighthouse of the Mediterranean" due to frequent, mild, incandescent eruptions (Strombolian activity).  |
