### saltation
transport of hard particles over uneven surface due to turbulent air flow
### dunes

| type               | description                                                                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| longitudinal dunes | formation -> parallel to the wind direction. windward slope - gentle , leeward - steep |
| transverse dunes   | formation - perpendicular to the wind direction,                                       |
| barchans           | crescent shape dunes, windward - convex , leeward - concave                            |
| parabolic dunes    | longer and narrower than barchans, windward - concave, leeward - convex                |
| star dunes         | high peak -> radially outward arms                                                     |
|                    |                                                                                        |
### loess
wind blown dust particles -> covers land -> this dust is mineral rich, fertile and drains water well -> this cover is called loess.
found in northern china -> yellow river, USA -> missouri river, russia and kazakhastan
