1. in adiabatic process  -> there is no heat transfer from the outside -> no energy gain or loss.
2. in case of adiabatic expansion -> there is +ve work done by the gas(F.S) -> this work is compensated by the kinetic energy of the gas -> temp is decreased.
3. vice versa for adiabatic compression
4. PV = nRT -> is applicable here but as P is not constant, we can not determine V-T relation by using this formula only.
5. dry air adiabatic temp change rate (atm) = 10 deg/ km
6. moist air adiabatic temp change rate (atm) = 5 deg/km

### significance
1. cooling of air at higher altitudes
2. cloud formation at higher altitudes.
3. orographic rainfall
4. leeward side of mountain -> having dry and **hotter** air, than windward side.
5.
