## Layers of Soil (Soil Horizons)

|Horizon|Common Name (Alternative Names)|Primary Composition|Typical Color|Key Characteristics|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**O**|**Organic Layer** (Humus Layer, Litter Layer)|Undifferentiated organic matter (leaves, twigs, dead plants, humus) in various stages of decomposition.|Dark brown to black|- Richest in organic matter & nutrients  <br>- High water retention  <br>- High biological activity (microorganisms, fungi, invertebrates)  <br>- Can be thin or absent in disturbed/dry soils|
|**A**|**Topsoil**|Mixed mineral particles (sand, silt, clay) with well-decomposed organic matter (humus).|Darker than deeper mineral layers (brownish-black, dark gray)|- Most fertile layer for plant growth  <br>- Active biological life  <br>- Good aeration & water infiltration  <br>- Subject to some eluviation (leaching)|
|**E**|**Eluviated Layer** (Leaching Layer)|Dominated by sand and silt, with clay, iron, aluminum oxides, and organic matter leached out.|Lighter (bleached, ash-gray, white)|- Lower in nutrients & organic matter  <br>- Present in older, well-developed soils (esp. acidic forest soils)  <br>- Lies between A and B horizons|
|**B**|**Subsoil** (Illuviation Layer)|Primarily mineral particles; accumulation (illuviation) of leached materials (clay, iron/aluminum oxides, carbonates).|Reddish, yellowish, brownish (colors from accumulated minerals)|- Denser & more compact than A horizon  <br>- Reservoir for water & nutrients for deep roots  <br>- Lower biological activity than A horizon  <br>- Plays role in soil structure|
|**C**|**Parent Material** (Substratum)|Partially weathered rock, gravel, and other unconsolidated material; little to no organic matter.|Resembles underlying bedrock (variable)|- Transition zone to bedrock  <br>- Not significantly affected by major soil-forming processes  <br>- Limited biological activity|
|**R**|**Bedrock**|Unweathered, solid underlying rock (e.g., granite, sandstone, limestone).|Varies by rock type|- Base of the soil profile  <br>- Not considered "soil"  <br>- Inaccessible to plant roots|
