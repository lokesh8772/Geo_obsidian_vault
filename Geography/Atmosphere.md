### ozone
1. 20-25 kms range
2. formed at higher altitudes and transported downwards
3. < 0.00005% by volume
4. three types of UV -
	1. UVA - reacches to deep sea levels
	2. UVB - reaches to surface
	3. UVC -> most energetic -> blocked by ozone

### Troposphere
1. 8-18 km thick
2. thicker at equator - heated air rises to more heights.
3. all weather phenomema occurs here(clouds, jet streams..)
4. lapse rate = 5 degree per km.
5. at the top -> equitorial region colder than polar region (lapse rate, more kms.)\
### stratosphere
1. temp rise - 5 degree per km in ozonosphere
2. at first temp constant then rises (ozone -> 20-25km)
3. airplanes....

### thermosphere
1. ionosphere - > used for radio transmission(reflected by it.)
