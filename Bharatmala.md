### üóìÔ∏è **Launch Date**
2017

### üßë‚Äçüè´ **Ministry / Department**
Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH)

### üéØ **Objective**
To optimize the efficiency of freight and passenger movement across the country by bridging critical infrastructure gaps. This includes developing economic corridors, inter-corridors and feeder routes, improving the efficiency of national corridors, enhancing border and international connectivity, and building coastal and port connectivity roads, as well as greenfield expressways. The aim is to connect 550 districts through national highway linkages (up from the existing 300), increase freight traffic on national highways to 80% (from the current 40%), and significantly improve the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) of India.

### üë• **Target Beneficiaries**
The entire nation, with specific benefits for freight and passenger transporters, industries, agricultural sector, and border regions. It also aims to create numerous direct and indirect employment opportunities.

### üí∞ **Features / Components / Assistance**
The Bharatmala Pariyojana encompasses several key components:

1.  **Economic Corridors (EC):** Development of approximately 9,000 km of corridors to link major economic centers, production hubs, and consumption zones.
2.  **Inter-Corridors and Feeder Routes:** Construction of around 6,000 km of roads to ensure first and last-mile connectivity to the economic corridors and the National Highway network.
3.  **National Corridor Efficiency Improvement:** Upgrading existing National Highways (NHs) by constructing elevated corridors, bypasses, ring roads, and expanding lanes to remove bottlenecks and enhance traffic flow over approximately 5,000 km.
4.  **Border and International Connectivity Roads:** Building about 2,000 km of roads along international borders and connecting to neighboring countries like Myanmar, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal to boost trade and strategic mobility.
5.  **Coastal and Port Connectivity Roads:** Enhancing connectivity to coastal areas and ports to facilitate port-led industrialization and streamline cargo movement. Approximately 2,000 km of roads are planned under this.
6.  **Greenfield Expressways:** Construction of around 800 km of high-speed, access-controlled expressways for faster movement between key economic hubs.
7.  **Residual National Highway Development Project (NHDP) Works:** Subsuming and completing the remaining projects under the erstwhile NHDP, covering about 10,000 km.
8.  **Logistics Parks:** Development of Multi-Modal Logistics Parks (MMLPs) at strategic locations to improve freight aggregation and distribution efficiency.

The project is primarily funded through a cess on petrol and diesel, toll collections, market borrowings, and budgetary allocations.

### üìç **Implementation Details**
The Bharatmala Pariyojana is being implemented by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) through agencies like the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd. (NHIDCL). Projects undergo technical, financial, and economic appraisal before execution. The implementation is phased, with Phase-I initially targeting completion by 2022, but now expected by 2027-28. The project leverages technologies like AI-MC, LIDAR, and drone-based analytics for efficient construction and monitoring.
