# Innovation for Defence Excellence

## 1. Launch Date

The iDEX framework was officially launched in **April 2018**. Subsequently, a central sector scheme for iDEX with budgetary support of ₹498.78 crore for five years (2021-22 to 2025-26) was launched in May 2021 to provide financial support to innovators and startups.

## 2. Ministry

The iDEX initiative is a flagship scheme of the **Ministry of Defence**, Government of India. It is established and managed by the Defence Innovation Organisation (DIO) under the Department of Defence Production.

## 3. Objective

The primary objective of iDEX is to create a vibrant ecosystem to foster innovation and technology development to achieve self-reliance in India's Defence and Aerospace sectors. It aims to engage with industries, particularly MSMEs and startups, to encourage co-creation and deliver technologically advanced solutions for modernizing the Indian military in a shorter time frame.

## 4. Key Beneficiaries

The main beneficiaries of the iDEX scheme are :

- Startups recognized by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT).
    
- Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs).
    
- Individual innovators.
    
- Academia and R&D institutes.
    

## 5. Features

The iDEX scheme operates through several key components:

- **Funding and Grants** The scheme provides financial assistance through grants. The **Support for Prototype and Research Kickstart (SPARK)** grant offers up to ₹1.5 crore for prototype development. The **iDEX Prime** initiative supports projects requiring funds beyond ₹1.5 crore, up to ₹10 crore.
    
- **Implementing Agency** iDEX is the executive arm of the Defence Innovation Organisation (DIO), a 'not-for-profit' company established by Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs) like HAL and BEL. DIO provides high-level policy guidance.
    
- **Innovation Challenges** The scheme launches platforms like the Defence India Start-up Challenge (DISC) and Open Challenges (OC), inviting innovators to solve specific problems faced by the Armed Forces and Defence PSUs.
    
- **Incubator Network** iDEX partners with leading incubators across the country to provide mentorship, technical support, and business guidance to the challenge winners.
    
- **Path to Procurement** The initiative is integrated into the Defence Acquisition Procedure (DAP) 2020, creating a direct path for the military to procure innovative solutions developed through the iDEX framework.
    

## 6. Achievements

Since its inception, iDEX has achieved several significant milestones:

- It has engaged with over 400 startups and MSMEs.
    
- As of June 2024, iDEX has signed over 350 contracts.
    
- Procurement of 35 indigenously developed items, valued at over ₹2,000 crore, has been cleared.
    
- iDEX received the Prime Minister's Award for Public Policy in the Innovation Category in 2021.
    
- It has successfully launched multiple editions of the Defence India Start-up Challenge (DISC) to source innovations.
    

## 7. Related Government Schemes

Several other government initiatives are linked to or complement the objectives of iDEX:

- [[ADITI]]
    
- [[Technology Development Fund (TDF) Scheme]]
    
- [[Make In India]]
    
- [[Startup India]]
    
- [[Atal Innovation Mission (AIM)]]
    

## 8. Shortcomings/Criticisms

While there are no direct criticisms specifically targeting the iDEX scheme, it operates within a broader ecosystem that faces certain systemic challenges:

- **Budgetary Constraints** The defence sector faces a shortfall in capital allocation for modernization, which can impact the overall ecosystem in which iDEX operates.
    
- **Low R&D Spending** India's national expenditure on R&D is relatively low at 0.7% of its GDP, posing a systemic challenge to fostering a deep-tech innovation culture.
    
- **Regulatory Hurdles** Historically, the broader defence sector has faced issues with complex regulations and restrictive procurement policies, which iDEX aims to simplify and bypass for innovators.
    

## 9. Way Forward

The future focus for iDEX is on scaling its impact and further integrating innovation into the defence establishment:

- **Enhanced Funding** The Ministry of Defence is seeking additional funds to continue and expand the scheme's reach and impact.
    
- **Deep-Tech Focus** Through the ADITI scheme, there is a clear push to develop deep-tech, critical, and strategic technologies domestically, focusing on areas like AI and quantum technologies.
    
- **Strengthening Collaboration** The plan is to continue fostering collaboration between the military, innovators, and industry through platforms like DefConnect to ensure technologies meet end-user needs effectively.
