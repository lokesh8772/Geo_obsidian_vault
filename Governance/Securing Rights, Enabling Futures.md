1. A report by UNDP on Forest Rights Act 2006
2. Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers(Recognition of Forest Rights) Act 2006
3. report examines implementation of FRA across Chattisgarh, Maharashtra and Odisha over 2 decades
## Findings/issues
1. high rejection rates -> due to lack of documentation, mis-interpretation of FRA provisions, and Procedural errors
2. Post-Recognition challenges -> Determination of Community Forest Resources and establishing of CFR Management Committees
3. limited involvement of Gram Sabha in the process.
4. social and informational barriers, uneven implementation across states
5. weak capacity at central and state levels + Poor inter-departmental co-ordination 
## Recommendations
1. Recognize the Forest Dwellers as separate category for all govtal schemes and welfare programmes
2. Establishing a dedicated fund for Forest Dwellers.
3. Introduce a sunset clause by Prescribing an end date for recognition.
4. integrate FRA and [[National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM)]] for gender sensitive livelihood opportunities
5. integrate FRA and [[PESA act]]
6. Strengthen Post-Rights support -> welfare approach to community empowerment.
