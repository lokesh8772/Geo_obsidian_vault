Plan to establish integrated theater commands for Army, Navy and Air Force. 
[[CDS]] is mandated to create theater commands

## Challenges 
1. IAF reservations -> fears the sharing of its limited resources would impact its operational flexibility
2. Domain knowledge -> single commander from one service, commanding and understanding the intricacies of assets of other services especially air power.
3. India-specific requirement -> can not blindly follow foreign approaches, due to uniqueness of indian assets and operational requirements,
4. during transition period -> disrupted structure and functioning of existing specific commands -> impact operational readiness
5. cost-benefit skepticism -> huge cost with uncertain benefits (why?)
## Significance
1. single command -> faster decisions -> greater operational readiness
2. elimination of duplication of manpower -> better resource management
3. better co-ordination in joint ops.
