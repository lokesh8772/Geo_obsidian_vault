1. every year floods in urban areas in monsoon season <- heavy rainfall, river overflowing,...dams..
2. Urban population -> 48 crore 2025 -> 95 crore(2 x) by 2050
3. by 2070 -> 2/3rd of urban residents -> prone to flooding -> $ 30 Billion losses
4. Heat Island effect -> 3-5 C increase in temp -> heat action plan(Ahemadabad role model)
5. Urban Flooding -> forecast model like Kolkata
6. Traffic , 10-20% blockage of roads can cripple 50% of the network -> improved drainage, green transport(Delhi metro)
7. Waste management like indore., waste to energy, 
8. weak institutional capacity  and private investment.
