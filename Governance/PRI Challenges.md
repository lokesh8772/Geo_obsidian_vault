1. Lower Budgetary allocation to PRI
2. Irregularity in elections
3. Irregularity in establishing SFCs(only 9 states constituted 6th SFC)
4. Imbalance between tied and untied grants(60%, 40%) -> underutilization of funds
5. lower Own Source Revenue Generation -> 1.1% of total revenue -> financial dependency
6. in-adequate upload of Gram Panchayat Development Plan on E-Gram Swaraj Portal -> cause issues in allocating funds of 15th FC to Panchayats
7. Poor functioning of District Planning Committees

## Initiatives
1. E-Gram Swaraj Portal -> where panchayats to upload their GPDPs
2. Audit Online App -> for online audit of panchayat accounts
3. use of SVAMITVA data for Property Tax Assessments
4. Ranking system for PRIs -> for performance based grants.
