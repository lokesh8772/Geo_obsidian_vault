 CPSU Scheme (Central Public Sector Undertaking Scheme) Phase-II

### 🗓️ **Launch Date**
Phase-II Approved: March 5, 2019
Guidelines: April 13, 2020 (amended June 2, 2021)

### 🧑‍🏫 **Ministry / Department**
Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE)

### 🎯 **Objective**
To promote the development of grid-connected Solar Photovoltaic (PV) power projects by Central and State Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs) and Government Organizations for self-use or use by Government/Government entities, using domestically manufactured solar PV cells and modules.

### 👥 **Target Beneficiaries**
Central and State PSUs, and Government Organizations. Private companies are not eligible.

### 💰 **Features / Components / Assistance**
- **Viability Gap Funding (VGF):** Financial support to bridge the cost difference between domestically manufactured and imported solar PV cells and modules.
- **VGF Amount:** Determined through a bidding process with VGF as the bidding parameter. Initially capped at ₹0.70 Cr/MW, later reduced to ₹0.55 Cr/MW for subsequent tranches.
- **Domestic Content Requirement (DCR):** Mandatory use of domestically manufactured solar PV cells and modules.
- **Project Capacity:** Aimed to support the development of 12,000 MW (12 GW) of grid-connected solar PV projects under Phase-II.

### 📍 **Implementation Details**
- Implemented by MNRE.
- **Implementing Agencies:**
    - Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) for Tranche-I & II (bids till Dec 31, 2020).
    - Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited (IREDA) for subsequent tranches (Tranche-III onwards).
- Selection of CPSUs through a bidding process based on VGF requirements.
- Power generated can be used for self-consumption or supplied to government entities/DISCOMs at mutually agreed usage charges (capped at ₹2.45/unit as of May 2021).
- Projects to be commissioned within 30 months from the date of the Letter of Award.

### 📈 **Achievements / Data**
- Approximately 8.2 GW capacity sanctioned to various CPSUs under Phase-II (as of MNRE data).
- Key beneficiaries include NTPC, SJVN Limited, NLC India Limited, NHPC Limited, and SECI.
- IREDA released a tentative list of bidders for 5 GW capacity under Tranche-III in September 2021.
- MNRE has granted time extensions for project commissioning under different tranches up to September 30, 2024.

### ⚠️ **Criticism / Challenges / Issues**
- Scheme relies on government entities for implementation and uptake.
- Ensuring timely commissioning of projects by CPSUs.
- Managing the cost implications of mandatory domestic content.

### ✍️ **Recent Updates / Current Affairs Angle**
- As of March 2025, Minister of State for New and Renewable Energy stated that the scheme supports various CPSUs with VGF for solar projects using Indian-made PV modules.
- NTPC has secured the largest allocation under CPSU Scheme Phase-II.
- CERC approved usage charges for NTPC's 1.99 GW solar PV project under the scheme.
