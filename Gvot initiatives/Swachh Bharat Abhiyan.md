- **Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM):** Initiatives for the collection, segregation, treatment, and disposal of solid and liquid waste in villages.
- **Information, Education and Communication (IEC):** Awareness campaigns to promote behavior change and the adoption of safe sanitation practices.

**2. Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban):**
- **Household Toilets:** Encouraging the construction of individual household toilets.
- **Community and Public Toilets:** Building accessible and well-maintained public sanitation facilities, especially in densely populated areas and commercial hubs.
- **Solid Waste Management:** Focus on door-to-door collection, segregation at source, processing, and scientific disposal of municipal solid waste.
- **Wastewater Treatment:** Emphasis on the treatment of sewage and fecal sludge management.
- **Information, Education and Communication (IEC):** Awareness campaigns for cleanliness and sanitation.
- **Capacity Building:** Training and skill development for urban local bodies (ULBs) and sanitation workers.

### 📍 **Implementation Details**

- **Toilet Construction:** Over 100 million individual household toilets have been built in rural areas and millions more in urban areas.
- **Improved Sanitation Coverage:** Rural household toilet coverage increased significantly from 32.7% in 2011 to a much higher percentage post-SBM.
- **Waste Management:** Increased focus on solid waste management, with efforts towards waste segregation and processing, although challenges remain.
