### üóìÔ∏è **Launch Date**
January 4, 2023

### üßë‚Äçüè´ **Ministry / Department**
Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE)

### üéØ **Objective**
To make India a global hub for the production, utilization, and export of Green Hydrogen and its derivatives. Aims to decarbonize industrial, transport, and power sectors, reduce dependence on fossil fuels, and promote indigenous manufacturing capabilities.

### üë• **Target Beneficiaries**
- Green Hydrogen and derivative producers
- Industries utilizing Green Hydrogen (e.g., refineries, fertilizers, steel)
- Transport sector (e.g., fuel cell vehicles)
- Power sector (e.g., energy storage, power generation)
- Research and development institutions
- Manufacturing sector for electrolyzers and related equipment

### üí∞ **Features / Components / Assistance**
- **Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) Programme:**
    - **Component I (Incentives for Electrolyser Manufacturing):** Financial incentives to boost domestic manufacturing of electrolyzers.
    - **Component II (Incentives for Green Hydrogen Production):** Financial support for the production of Green Hydrogen and its derivatives.
- **Development of Green Hydrogen Hubs:** Identification and development of regions with high potential for Green Hydrogen production and utilization.
- **R&D Support:** Funding for research and development projects focused on Green Hydrogen technologies.
- **Skill Development Programme:** Training and skilling initiatives to create a skilled workforce for the Green Hydrogen sector.
- **Pilot Projects:** Supporting pilot projects in various sectors to demonstrate the application of Green Hydrogen.
- **Establishment of Standards and Regulations:** Developing standards, regulations, and a certification framework for Green Hydrogen.
- **Facilitation of Market Development:** Measures to promote demand creation and market development for Green Hydrogen.

### üìç **Implementation Details**
- Implemented by MNRE in collaboration with various ministries, agencies, and stakeholders.
- Guidelines for the SIGHT programme have been issued, outlining the incentive mechanisms and eligibility criteria.
- Development of Green Hydrogen hubs involves state governments and relevant industrial clusters.
