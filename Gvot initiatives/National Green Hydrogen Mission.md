# National Green Hydrogen Mission

## 1. Started - 2023

## 2. Nodal Ministry
Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), Government of India

## 3. Goal
To make India the Global Hub for production, usage, and export of Green Hydrogen and its derivatives. This will contribute to India's aim to become Aatmanirbhar (self-reliant) through clean energy and serve as an inspiration for the global Clean Energy Transition.

## 4. Aim
* Develop a green hydrogen production capacity of at least 5 Million Metric Tonnes (MMT) per annum by 2030.
* Add about 125 GW of renewable energy capacity in India by 2030.
* Entail over ₹8 lakh crore in total investments.
* Create over six lakh jobs.
* Achieve a cumulative reduction in fossil fuel imports by over ₹1 lakh crore.
* Abate nearly 50 MMT of annual greenhouse gas emissions.
* Establish India as a leader in technology and manufacturing of electrolysers and other enabling technologies for Green Hydrogen.
* Develop and scale up Green Hydrogen production technology and make it affordable and widely accessible.
* Facilitate the replacement of fossil fuels and fossil fuel-based feedstocks with renewable fuels and feedstocks based on Green Hydrogen.
* Capture about 10% of the global green hydrogen market by aiming to export about 10 MMT of Green Hydrogen/Green Ammonia per annum by 2030.

## 5. Initiatives (or Key Features)
* **Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) Programme:** This includes financial incentives for:
    * Domestic manufacturing of electrolysers.
    * Production of green hydrogen.
* **Development of Green Hydrogen Hubs:** Identifying and developing regions capable of supporting large-scale production and/or utilization of hydrogen. At least two such hubs are planned in the initial phase.
* **Research and Development (R&D):** Facilitating a public-private partnership framework for R&D (Strategic Hydrogen Innovation Partnership – SHIP) with a dedicated R&D fund.
* **Enabling Policy Framework:** Including measures like waiver of Interstate transmission charges for renewable energy used for Green Hydrogen production, facilitating renewable energy banking, and time-bound grant of Open Access and connectivity.
* **Infrastructure Development:** Supporting the development of supply chains for efficient transportation and distribution of hydrogen, including pipelines, tankers, storage facilities, and last-mile distribution networks.
* **Regulations and Standards:** Establishing a framework of regulations and standards to facilitate the growth of the sector and ensure harmonization with international norms.
* **Skill Development:** Implementing a coordinated skill development program covering various segments in coordination with the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship.
* **Pilot Projects:** Supporting pilot projects in various areas, including decentralized energy applications, hydrogen production from biomass, and hydrogen storage technologies.
* **Public Awareness, Stakeholder Outreach, and International Cooperation:** Activities to promote awareness, engage stakeholders, and foster international collaborations.
* **National Portal:** A dedicated online portal to provide information and facilitate the development of the green hydrogen ecosystem in India.
* **Hydrogen Valley Innovation Clusters:** Initiatives by the Department of Science and Technology to foster innovation and promote the green hydrogen ecosystem.
* **Green Hydrogen Standard for India:** Defining emission thresholds for classifying hydrogen as 'Green'.

## 6. Achievements (if any)
* As of May 2025, significant progress has been made in establishing the framework and initiating various components of the mission.
* Over ₹400 crore allocated up to 2025-26 for hubs and other projects.
* Eight companies awarded contracts for electrolyser manufacturing under the SIGHT scheme, with a total capacity of 1,500 MW per annum (as of January 2024).
* Increased yearly allocation of Green Ammonia for the fertiliser sector to 750,000 tonnes to meet rising demand (as of June 2024).
* Launch of a dedicated portal for the mission and steps for developing the green hydrogen ecosystem.
* Release of scheme guidelines for the use of Green Hydrogen in steel, transport, and shipping sectors.
* Development of a Research & Development Roadmap for the National Green Hydrogen Mission.
* Notification of the Green Hydrogen standard for India.
* Launch of the Green Hydrogen page on the National Single Window System (NSWS) for project approvals.

## 7. Any Significant Development in Current
* Focus on scaling up pilot projects and demonstrating the use of green hydrogen in various sectors.
* Ongoing efforts to finalize regulations and standards to provide clarity and attract investment.
* Emphasis on establishing the initial Green Hydrogen Hubs and developing the necessary infrastructure.
* Continued engagement with international partners to explore export opportunities and collaborations on technology development.
* Further advancements in R&D, particularly in reducing the cost of electrolysers and improving efficiency.
* Increased emphasis on skill development initiatives to create a skilled workforce for the emerging green hydrogen sector.
* Monitoring and evaluation of the initial phase of the SIGHT program to inform future strategies and incentives.
