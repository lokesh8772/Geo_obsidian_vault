### 🗓️ **Launch Date**
March 2019

### 🧑‍🏫 **Ministry / Department**
Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE)

### 🎯 **Objective**
To enhance farmers' income, provide irrigation sources, de-dieselize the agriculture sector, and promote the use of solar energy in agriculture.

### 👥 **Target Beneficiaries**
- Individual farmers
- Groups of farmers
- Cooperatives
- Panchayats
- Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs)
- Water User Associations (WUAs)

### 💰 **Features / Components / Assistance**
- **Component A:** Setting up decentralized grid-connected renewable energy power plants (0.5 to 2 MW) on barren/fallow/cultivable land. Farmers can sell power to DISCOMs. Incentive for DISCOMs for power procurement.
- **Component B:** Installation of standalone solar agriculture pumps (up to 7.5 HP) in off-grid areas. Central Financial Assistance (CFA) up to 30-50%, with state subsidy and farmer contribution.
- **Component C:** Solarization of existing grid-connected agriculture pumps (up to 7.5 HP). Farmers can use generated power and sell surplus to DISCOMs. Includes individual pump solarization and feeder-level solarization. Financial assistance similar to Component B.

### 📍 **Implementation Details**
- Implemented by MNRE through State Nodal Agencies and DISCOMs.
- Online portals and mobile apps for application.
- Farmers contribute a portion of the cost (around 10-40%).
