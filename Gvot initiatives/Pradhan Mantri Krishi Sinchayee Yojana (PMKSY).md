### 🗓️ **Launch Date**
1st July 2015

### 🧑‍🏫 **Ministry / Department**
Ministry of Jal Shakti

### 🎯 **Objective**
To enhance physical access of water on farm and expand cultivable area under assured irrigation, improve on-farm water use efficiency to reduce wastage of water, enhance the adoption of precision-irrigation and other water saving technologies.

### 👥 **Target Beneficiaries**
- All farmers across the country
- Agricultural land requiring irrigation
- Water user associations
- Panchayati Raj Institutions

### 💰 **Features / Components / Assistance**
- **Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP):** Focuses on completing ongoing major and medium irrigation projects. Provides financial assistance to states.
- **Har Khet Ko Pani (HKKP):**
    - **Surface Minor Irrigation (SMI):** Renovation and restoration of traditional water bodies, construction of new SMI schemes.
    - **Command Area Development & Water Management (CAD&WM):** Improving water use efficiency through field channels, warabandi, etc.
    - **Ground Water (GW):** Development of ground water resources in water-stressed areas.
- **Per Drop More Crop (PDMC):** Focuses on micro-irrigation technologies like drip and sprinkler irrigation. Provides financial assistance to farmers (Central assistance varies by category, generally 50-75% of the cost). Also promotes water harvesting structures, secondary storage, and water conveyance.

### 📍 **Implementation Details**
- Centrally sponsored scheme with funding sharing between the Centre and States.
- Implemented through various State Level Nodal Agencies (SLNAs) and line departments (Irrigation, Agriculture, etc.).
- Convergence with other schemes like MGNREGA for water harvesting structures.
- Online monitoring system and geo-tagging of assets.
- District Irrigation Plans (DIPs) prepared at the district level to identify needs and strategies.

### 📈 **Achievements / Data**
- Significant increase in area brought under irrigation since launch.
- Over 1.45 lakh hectare area covered under micro-irrigation during 2023-24 (as per latest reports).
- Completion of several long-pending AIBP projects.
- Creation of water harvesting structures and rejuvenation of traditional water bodies.
- Increased awareness and adoption of water-efficient irrigation technologies.

### 🧩 **Linkages / Related Schemes**
- [[MGNREGS]]
- [[Soil Health Card Scheme]]
- [[PM-KUSUM]] (for solar irrigation pumps)
- [[Atal Bhujal Yojana]] (for groundwater management)


### ⚠️ **Criticism / Challenges / Issues**
- Slow implementation in some states.
- Issues with fund flow and coordination between different agencies.
- Need for better last-mile connectivity of irrigation facilities.
- Ensuring equitable distribution of water.
- Awareness and adoption of micro-irrigation need further push in certain regions.

### ✍️ **Recent Updates / Current Affairs Angle**
- Focus on completing prioritized projects under AIBP and HKKP.
- Emphasis on water conservation and efficient water use in agriculture due to increasing water scarcity.
- Promotion of micro-irrigation through increased subsidies and awareness campaigns.
- Integration of technology like remote sensing and GIS for better planning and monitoring.
- Discussions on inter-state water disputes and the role of PMKSY in addressing them.
