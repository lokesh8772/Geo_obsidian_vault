### üßë‚Äçüè´ **Ministry / Department**
Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA)

### üéØ **Objective**
To enhance the quality of life in 100 selected cities by providing efficient services, robust infrastructure, and a sustainable environment through the application of 'Smart Solutions'. The mission aims to drive economic growth and improve the quality of life of people by enabling local area development and harnessing technology, especially in the social, economic, physical, and institutional pillars of the city.

### üë• **Target Beneficiaries**
Residents of the 100 selected cities across India.

### üí∞ **Features / Components / Assistance**
The Smart Cities Mission adopts a two-pronged strategy:

1.  **Area-Based Development (ABD):** Focused interventions in specific areas within the selected cities, chosen through citizen participation. This includes:
    * **Retrofitting:** Upgrading existing infrastructure and services in identified areas to make them smarter and more efficient.
    * **Redevelopment:** Replacing existing built environment with new layouts, enhanced infrastructure, and mixed land use.
    * **Greenfield Development:** Developing entirely new areas with smart infrastructure and solutions.

2.  **Pan-City Initiatives:** Implementation of smart solutions that benefit the entire city, often leveraging technology.

The core infrastructure elements envisioned in a Smart City include:
* Adequate water supply
* Assured electricity supply
* Sanitation, including solid waste management
* Efficient urban mobility and public transport
* Affordable housing, especially for the poor
* Robust IT connectivity and digitalization
* Good governance, especially e-governance and citizen participation
* Sustainable environment
* Safety and security of citizens, particularly women, children, and the elderly
* Health and education

The Central Government proposed to give financial support of ‚Çπ48,000 crore over five years, leveraging additional resources from states, urban local bodies, and through public-private partnerships.
