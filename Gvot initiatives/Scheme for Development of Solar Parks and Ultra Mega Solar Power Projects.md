## 1. Started - 2014

## 2. Nodal Ministry
Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE)

## 3. Goal
Facilitate large-scale solar power deployment; energy security, ecological sustainability.

## 4. Aim
* Create solar parks with plug-and-play infrastructure.
* Reduce solar project gestation period.
* Provide secure investment environment.
* Enhance solar power generation capacity.
* Attract domestic and foreign investment.
* Promote economies of scale, lower tariffs.
* Support renewable energy targets, climate commitments.

## 5. Initiatives (or Key Features)
* Development of Solar Parks: financial support for infrastructure (land, roads, water, grid).
* Central Financial Assistance (CFA): initially ₹25 lakh/park (DPR), ₹20 lakh/MW or 30% cost (milestones).
* Ultra Mega Solar Power Projects (UMPPs): large projects (>= 500 MW) within parks.
* Plug and Play Infrastructure.
* Single Window Clearance (efforts).
* State Nodal Agencies (SNAs) involvement.
* Phased Implementation.

## 6. Achievements (if any)
* Solar Parks Sanctioned -> 70 parks -> 37.99 GW capacity (as of June 2023).
* Solar Parks Completed -> 11 parks -> 8.521 GW capacity (as of July 2023).
* Solar Projects Installed (within parks) -> 10.237 GW capacity (as of July 2023).
* Investments Mobilized -> Significant (data not readily available in specific figures).
* Tariff Reduction -> Solar tariffs decreased significantly post scheme launch.

### Negatives
* Commissioning vs. Sanctioned Capacity -> Significant gap (approx. 27.7 GW sanctioned, not yet commissioned as of July 2023).
* Land Acquisition -> Hurdles and delays in some states.
* Grid Connectivity -> Challenges in timely and adequate grid infrastructure in all parks.
* Regulatory Risks -> Policy changes impacting project feasibility.

## 7. Any Significant Development in Current
* Scheme extended until March 31, 2026.
