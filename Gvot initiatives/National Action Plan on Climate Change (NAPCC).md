# üìå National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC)

### üóìÔ∏è **Launch Date**
June 30, 2008

### üßë‚Äçüè´ **Ministry / Department**
Prime Minister's Council on Climate Change (PMCCC); Coordinated by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) with specific missions led by respective ministries.

### üéØ **Objective**
The National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) outlines India's strategy to simultaneously advance its development and climate change-related objectives through a set of eight (originally, now considered nine with the inclusion of the National Mission on Electric Mobility) National Missions. The core focus is on promoting understanding of climate change, adaptation and mitigation, energy efficiency, and natural resource conservation, while ensuring ecological sustainability alongside economic development. The plan emphasizes protecting the poor and vulnerable sections of society.

### üë• **Target Beneficiaries**
The entire population of India, with specific focus on vulnerable communities and sectors affected by climate change.

### üí∞ **Features / Components / Assistance**
The NAPCC comprises the following **National Missions**:

1.  **National Solar Mission:** Aims to promote the development and use of solar energy technologies for power generation and other applications, with the long-term goal of making solar energy competitive with fossil-based energy options. Targets have evolved significantly, aiming for a substantial increase in solar power capacity.

2.  **National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE):** Seeks to create a market-based mechanism to enhance the cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency improvements in energy-intensive industries and promote energy conservation across sectors.

3.  **National Mission on Sustainable Habitat (NMSH):** Focuses on promoting energy efficiency in buildings, improved urban planning, sustainable transport systems, and better management of solid and liquid waste.

4.  **National Water Mission (NWM):** Aims to conserve water, minimize wastage, and ensure more equitable distribution of water resources through integrated water resources management. The goal is a 20% improvement in water use efficiency.

5.  **National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem (NMSHE):** Focuses on protecting the fragile Himalayan ecosystem, including its glaciers, biodiversity, and forests. It is led by the Department of Science and Technology (DST).

6.  **National Mission for a Green India (GIM):** Aims at afforestation of degraded forest lands and increasing the country's forest cover to enhance carbon sinks and ecosystem services.

7.  **National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA):** Seeks to support climate adaptation in agriculture through the development of climate-resilient crops, improved irrigation practices, and sustainable agricultural practices.

8.  **National Mission on Strategic Knowledge for Climate Change (NMSKCC):** Aims to build a strong strategic knowledge system on climate science and its impacts, involving enhanced research, improved climate modeling, and international collaboration. It is led by the Department of Science and Technology (DST).

9.  **National Mission on Electric Mobility (NMEM) (often considered a de facto ninth mission):** Focuses on promoting the adoption of electric vehicles and developing the necessary infrastructure.

Each mission is anchored under a specific ministry responsible for its implementation, budgetary provisions, and actionable priorities.

### üìç **Implementation Details**
-   The Prime Minister's Council on Climate Change oversees the NAPCC.
-   The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) coordinates the overall implementation.
-   Respective ministries lead and implement the individual National Missions, developing objectives, strategies, timelines, and monitoring mechanisms.
-   Implementation involves a mix of top-down and bottom-up approaches, engaging various government agencies, research institutions, industries, and communities.
-   State governments and Union Territories also formulate their State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCCs) aligned with the NAPCC.
-   Progress is periodically reviewed and reported by the concerned ministries and the PMCCC.

### üìà **Achievements / Data** (As of May 2025 - Note that comprehensive, consolidated data across all missions is complex and evolving)
-   **National Solar Mission:** Significant increase in solar power capacity, exceeding initial targets. India has become a major player in solar energy.
-   **National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency:** Implementation of schemes like PAT (Perform, Achieve and Trade) has led to energy savings in industries.
-   **National Mission on Sustainable Habitat:** Efforts towards energy-efficient building codes and promotion of public transport in urban areas.
-   **National Water Mission:** Initiatives for water conservation and improved water management in various states.
-   **National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem:** Research and monitoring activities related to Himalayan glaciers and ecosystems.
-   **National Mission for a Green India:** Increased afforestation efforts and initiatives for improving forest quality.
-   **National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture:** Promotion of climate-resilient agricultural practices and crop diversification.
-   **National Mission on Strategic Knowledge for Climate Change:** Establishment of research networks and enhanced climate modeling capabilities.
-   **National Mission on Electric Mobility:** Increased adoption of electric vehicles and development of charging infrastructure.

*Note: Specific quantitative achievements vary across missions and are continuously updated by the respective ministries.*
