## 1. Started - 2019 (Phase II Approval)

## 2. Nodal Ministry
Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), Government of India

## 3. Goal
To achieve a cumulative installed capacity of 40,000 MW from Grid Connected Rooftop Solar (RTS) projects by 2022 (extended to 31.03.2026).

## 4. Aim
* Promote grid-connected RTS in all consumer segments (residential, institutional, social, government, commercial, industrial, etc.).
* Make DISCOMs the key drivers for the rapid deployment of RTS.
* Create awareness, capacity building, and human resource development.
* Promote sustainable business models for RTS.
* Reduce electricity bills for consumers.
* Reduce transmission and distribution losses.
* Contribute to carbon emission reduction and long-term energy and environmental security.
* Reduce system congestion and increase tail-end line voltage.

## 5. Initiatives (or Key Features)
* **Central Financial Assistance (CFA) for the Residential Sector (Component A):**
    * Up to 3 kW capacity: 40% of the benchmark cost or cost discovered through competitive bidding, whichever is lower.
    * Above 3 kW and up to 10 kW capacity: 40% for the first 3 kW and 20% for the remaining capacity.
    * Group Housing Societies/Residential Welfare Associations (GHS/RWA): ₹18,000 per kW for common facilities (including EV charging) up to 500 kW capacity (limited to ₹3 kW per house).
* **Incentives to DISCOMs (Component B):** Performance-linked incentives to DISCOMs based on the capacity of rooftop solar added in their distribution area.
* **National Portal for Rooftop Solar (pmsuryaghar.gov.in):** A single platform for registration, application, vendor selection, tracking progress, and subsidy disbursement.
* **Empanelment of Vendors by DISCOMs:** Ensuring quality and adherence to technical specifications.
* **Net Metering:** Allowing consumers to sell surplus solar power back to the grid and get credit in their electricity bills.
* **Domestic Content Requirement (DCR):** Encouraging the use of domestically manufactured solar modules and cells.
* **Simplified Procedure for Installation:** Streamlined process through the National Portal.
* **Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) of Subsidy:** CFA is directly transferred to the consumer's bank account after successful installation and verification.

## 6. Achievements (if any)
* Significant increase in grid-connected rooftop solar capacity installation across the country.
* Over 10 lakh homes solar-powered as of March 2025 under the broader rooftop solar initiatives, including this program.
* Development of a robust ecosystem of vendors and installers.
* Increased awareness among consumers about the benefits of rooftop solar.
* Several states and UTs have made substantial progress in implementing the scheme.

## 7. Any Significant Development in Current
* The program period has been extended until March 31, 2026.
* Continued focus on increasing residential rooftop solar installations through the simplified National Portal.
* Emphasis on improving DISCOM engagement and streamlining the net metering process.
* Integration with the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana to further accelerate rooftop solar adoption in the residential sector.
* Ongoing efforts to ensure the quality and safety of rooftop solar installations.
