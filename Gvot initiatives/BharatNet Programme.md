### üóìÔ∏è **Launch Date**
October 2011 (initially launched as the National Optical Fibre Network - NOFN, renamed BharatNet in 2015)

### üßë‚Äçüè´ **Ministry / Department**
Department of Telecommunications (DoT), Ministry of Communications

### üéØ **Objective**
The BharatNet Programme is a flagship initiative under the Digital India Programme with the primary objective of providing high-speed broadband connectivity to all Gram Panchayats (GPs) in the country, aiming to bridge the digital divide between urban and rural India. The key objectives include:

-   Providing a minimum bandwidth of 100 Mbps to all GPs.
-   Enabling the delivery of various e-services such as e-governance, e-health, e-education, e-banking, internet, and other citizen-centric services to rural areas.
-   Facilitating non-discriminatory access to the BharatNet infrastructure for all Telecom Service Providers (TSPs), Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and other service providers to extend their services in rural India.
-   Promoting digital inclusion and empowering rural communities through access to information and opportunities.
-   Boosting economic growth in rural areas by enabling e-commerce, telemedicine, online education, and other digital activities.

### üë• **Target Beneficiaries**
Primarily the rural population of India, including households, government institutions (schools, healthcare centers), businesses, and service providers operating in rural areas.

### üí∞ **Features / Components / Assistance**
The BharatNet Programme is being implemented in phases:

-   **Phase I (Completed in December 2017):** Connected 1 lakh GPs using underground Optical Fiber Cable (OFC) and existing infrastructure.
-   **Phase II (Ongoing):** Expanding coverage to an additional 1.5 lakh GPs using a mix of OFC, radio, and satellite technologies, with the involvement of state governments and private entities.
-   **Phase III (Ongoing - Amended BharatNet Program (ABP) approved in August 2023):** Aims to future-proof the network by integrating 5G technologies, increasing bandwidth capacity, ensuring robust last-mile connectivity to all 2.64 lakh GPs in a ring topology, and extending OFC connectivity to non-GP villages on demand. This phase also focuses on operation and maintenance for 10 years, power backup, and a Remote Fibre Monitoring System (RFMS).

Key features include:

-   Laying of a vast optical fiber network across rural India.
-   Establishing a middle-mile network connecting blocks to GPs.
-   Facilitating last-mile connectivity through various technologies, including Wi-Fi hotspots and Fibre-to-the-Home (FTTH) connections.
-   Utilizing a ring topology for better network stability under the ABP.
-   Offering bandwidth and dark fiber services to service providers at affordable rates.
-   Funding primarily through the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN), which replaced the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF).

### üìç **Implementation Details**
The BharatNet project is executed by Bharat Broadband Network Limited (BBNL), a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) under the Department of Telecommunications. The implementation involves collaboration between the Union Government, State Governments, and private sector companies.

-   **Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs)** like BSNL, RailTel, and PGCIL played a significant role in Phase I.
-   **State-led models** were adopted in some states for laying OFC and radio connectivity.
-   **Public-Private Partnerships (PPP)** are being utilized to accelerate implementation and last-mile connectivity.
-   **Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs)** are being engaged for last-mile connectivity and maintenance in many areas.
-   The **Amended BharatNet Program (ABP)** emphasizes a centralized Network Operating Centre (CNOC) for monitoring and payments to Project Implementation Agencies (PIAs) based on Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

### üìà **Achievements / Data** (As of March/April 2025)
-   Approximately **2.18 lakh Gram Panchayats** have been made service-ready.
-   Over **42.13 lakh route km** of Optical Fiber Cable (OFC) has been laid.
-   More than **12.21 lakh Fibre-To-The-Home (FTTH)** connections have been commissioned.
-   Over **1.04 lakh Wi-Fi hotspots** have been installed.
-   BharatNet is recognized as the **world's largest rural broadband connectivity program**.
-   It has facilitated access to various online services, including e-governance, e-education, and telemedicine, in rural areas.
