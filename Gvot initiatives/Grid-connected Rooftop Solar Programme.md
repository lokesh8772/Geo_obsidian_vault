### üóìÔ∏è **Launch Date**
Phase-I: Not a specific date, started around 2010-2014
Phase-II: March 8, 2019

### üßë‚Äçüè´ **Ministry / Department**
Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE)

### üéØ **Objective**
To achieve a cumulative installed capacity of 40,000 MW (40 GW) from Grid-Connected Rooftop Solar (RTS) projects by 2022 (extended to 2026). Aims to promote solar energy adoption, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and enable consumers to generate their own electricity.

### üë• **Target Beneficiaries**
- Residential consumers
- Group Housing Societies (GHS) / Resident Welfare Associations (RWA)
- Commercial, industrial, government, educational, and institutional sectors

### üí∞ **Features / Components / Assistance**
- **Phase-II Focus:** Primarily on the residential sector with Central Financial Assistance (CFA) / subsidy. Incentives also provided to Distribution Companies (DISCOMs).
- **CFA for Residential Sector:**
    - ‚Çπ30,000 per kW for the first 2 kW capacity.
    - ‚Çπ18,000 per kW for additional capacity beyond 2 kW and up to 3 kW.
    - Total subsidy capped at ‚Çπ78,000 for systems larger than 3 kW.
    - Additional 10% subsidy for special category states (North-eastern states including Sikkim, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, UT of Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Lakshadweep, and Andaman & Nicobar Islands).
- **CFA for GHS/RWA:** ‚Çπ18,000 per kW for common facilities (including EV charging) up to 500 kW capacity (limited to ‚Çπ3 kW per house).
- **Net Metering:** Allows consumers to feed surplus solar power into the grid and get compensated as per regulations.
- **National Portal:** Streamlined online process for registration, vendor selection, and subsidy disbursal (pmsuryaghar.gov.in).
- **DISCOM Involvement:** DISCOMs are key drivers for implementation, empaneling vendors and verifying installations.

### üìç **Implementation Details**
- Implemented by MNRE with DISCOMs as the primary agencies.
- Residential consumers apply through the National Portal or DISCOM portals.
- Empaneled vendors install the rooftop solar systems.
- DISCOMs verify the installation, and CFA is directly transferred to the consumer's account or adjusted in the vendor's payment.
- Domestically manufactured solar modules using domestically manufactured solar cells (ALMM listed) and BIS-certified inverters are generally preferred/mandated for subsidy.

### üìà **Achievements / Data**
- Cumulative installed capacity under the Grid-connected Rooftop Solar Programme reached 10.4 GW as of November 30, 2023.
- Residential sector installations have significantly increased under Phase-II.
- Over 2.6 GW capacity installed under the subsidy scheme of Phase-II as of November 30, 2023.
- The program has been extended until March 31, 2026.

- [[Solar PV Module PLI Scheme]] (for boosting domestic manufacturing).
- Various state-level rooftop solar policies and incentives.
- [[National Solar Mission]].

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Criticism / Challenges / Issues**
- Achieving the ambitious 40 GW target by the extended deadline remains a challenge.
- Awareness and adoption in some states and consumer segments need to be improved.
- Ensuring timely disbursal of subsidies.
- Technical challenges related to grid integration and net metering.
- Dependence on DISCOMs' proactive participation.
- Quality control and standardization of installations.

### ‚úçÔ∏è **Recent Updates / Current Affairs Angle**
- The program has been extended until March 31, 2026, without changes to the initial financial outlay.
- Focus on increasing residential adoption through the simplified National Portal (PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana).
- Continued emphasis on using domestically manufactured solar components.
- Efforts to streamline the application and approval process through digital platforms.
- Promotion of rooftop solar along with electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure in residential areas.
