### üóìÔ∏è **Launch Date**
March 2020 (first launched for Mobile Manufacturing and Specified Electronic Components)

### üßë‚Äçüè´ **Ministry / Department**
Various Ministries depending on the sector, with overall coordination by NITI Aayog.

### üéØ **Objective**
To boost domestic manufacturing, attract large investments, enhance India's manufacturing capabilities, promote exports, reduce import dependence, and generate employment. The scheme provides financial incentives to companies based on incremental sales from products manufactured in domestic units.

### üë• **Target Beneficiaries**
Domestic and foreign companies engaged in manufacturing within the identified sectors. Eligibility criteria vary across different PLI schemes for specific sectors.

- **Performance-linked incentives:** Companies receive financial rewards based on their incremental sales over a base year for a specified duration (typically 5 years, can vary).
- **Sector-specific schemes:** PLI schemes have been launched for various sectors with varying incentive rates and eligibility criteria.
- **Focus on key sectors:** The scheme targets sectors with high growth potential, significant import dependence, and potential for export competitiveness.
- **Incentives on incremental sales:** The incentive is calculated as a percentage of the increase in sales of domestically manufactured goods compared to a defined base year.
- **Emphasis on local value addition:** Some sector-specific schemes may also consider the extent of local value addition in the manufacturing process for incentives.
- **Attracting investments:** The scheme aims to incentivize both domestic companies to expand their production and foreign companies to set up manufacturing units in India.

**Key Sectors Covered (as of May 2025):**
- Mobile Manufacturing and Specified Electronic Components
