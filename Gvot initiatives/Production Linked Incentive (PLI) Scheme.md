### 🗓️ **Launch Date**
March 2020 (first launched for Mobile Manufacturing and Specified Electronic Components)

### 🧑‍🏫 **Ministry / Department**
Various Ministries depending on the sector, with overall coordination by NITI Aayog.

### 🎯 **Objective**
To boost domestic manufacturing, attract large investments, enhance India's manufacturing capabilities, promote exports, reduce import dependence, and generate employment. The scheme provides financial incentives to companies based on incremental sales from products manufactured in domestic units.

### 👥 **Target Beneficiaries**
Domestic and foreign companies engaged in manufacturing within the identified sectors. Eligibility criteria vary across different PLI schemes for specific sectors.

### 💰 **Features / Components / Assistance**
- **Performance-linked incentives:** Companies receive financial rewards based on their incremental sales over a base year for a specified duration (typically 5 years, can vary).
- **Sector-specific schemes:** PLI schemes have been launched for various sectors with varying incentive rates and eligibility criteria.
- **Focus on key sectors:** The scheme targets sectors with high growth potential, significant import dependence, and potential for export competitiveness.
- **Incentives on incremental sales:** The incentive is calculated as a percentage of the increase in sales of domestically manufactured goods compared to a defined base year.
- **Emphasis on local value addition:** Some sector-specific schemes may also consider the extent of local value addition in the manufacturing process for incentives.
- **Attracting investments:** The scheme aims to incentivize both domestic companies to expand their production and foreign companies to set up manufacturing units in India.

**Key Sectors Covered (as of May 2025):**
- Mobile Manufacturing and Specified Electronic Components
- Pharmaceuticals, Drugs, and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs)
- Manufacturing of Medical Devices
- Automobiles and Auto Components
- Telecom and Networking Products
- Food Processing
- Textiles and Apparels
- White Goods (ACs and LEDs)
- Specialty Steel
- Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery
- Solar PV Modules
- Drones and Drone Components
- IT Hardware
- Chemicals

*Note: The specific details of incentives, eligibility, and duration vary for each sector-specific PLI scheme.*

### 📍 **Implementation Details**
- Implemented by the respective Ministries for each sector through designated Project Management Agencies (PMAs).
- Companies need to apply under the specific PLI scheme for their sector.
- Incentives are disbursed based on the verification of incremental sales and adherence to other scheme guidelines.
- Monitoring and evaluation mechanisms are in place to track the progress and impact of the schemes.

### 📈 **Achievements / Data** (As of November 2024 - Data can vary across sectors and is continuously updated)
- Significant investments have been realized across various sectors.
- Increased domestic production and reduced import dependence in some sectors like mobile manufacturing.
- Growth in exports in sectors like electronics and pharmaceuticals.
- Job creation in the manufacturing sector.
- Increased focus on local value addition and technological advancements in some sectors.

*Note: Specific data on investments, production, exports, and job creation varies significantly across the 14+ sectors covered under the PLI scheme. Refer to the respective Ministry's reports for detailed sector-wise achievements.*

### 🧩 **Linkages / Related Schemes**
