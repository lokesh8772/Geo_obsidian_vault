
### üóìÔ∏è **Launch Date**
August 15, 2019 (restructuring of National Rural Drinking Water Programme - NRDWP)

### üßë‚Äçüè´ **Ministry / Department**
Department of Drinking Water & Sanitation, Ministry of Jal Shakti

### üéØ **Objective**
To provide safe and adequate drinking water through individual household tap connections (Functional Household Tap Connections - FHTCs) to all households in rural India by 2024 (now extended to December 31, 2028), with a focus on ensuring long-term sustainability of water sources and infrastructure. The mission also aims to provide functional tap connections to schools, Anganwadi centers, Gram Panchayat buildings, health and wellness centers, and community buildings.

### üë• **Target Beneficiaries**
All rural households in India, with priority given to quality-affected areas, drought-prone regions, desert areas, and Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) villages. Additionally, all schools, Anganwadi centers, and public institutions in rural areas.

### üí∞ **Features / Components / Assistance**
- **Functional Household Tap Connections (FHTCs):** Providing 55 liters of potable water per capita per day (lpcd) regularly on a long-term basis to every rural household.
- **Source Sustainability:** Implementing measures for the sustainability of water sources, including recharge and reuse through greywater management, water conservation, and rainwater harvesting.
- **Infrastructure Development:** Creating or upgrading in-village piped water supply systems, bulk water transfer, treatment plants, and distribution networks.
- **Technological Interventions:** Utilizing technologies for contaminant removal in areas with water quality issues and employing sensor-based IoT solutions for water supply measurement.
- **Community Participation:** Based on a community-driven approach ("Jan Andolan" for water) with voluntary ownership through contributions in cash, kind, or labor (shramdaan).
- **Capacity Building:** Empowering and developing human resources in the water sector and training local communities for operation and maintenance.
- **Water Quality Monitoring:** Establishing a robust quality assurance and monitoring system, including training women to test water samples using Field Test Kits (FTKs).
- **Transparency and Monitoring:** Tracking progress through an online 'JJM dashboard' and mobile app, with geo-tagging of assets and Aadhaar linking for targeted delivery.
- **Financial Sharing:** Cost sharing between the Central Government and States/UTs in varying ratios (100:0, 90:10, and 50:50).

### üìç **Implementation Details**
- Implemented by the Department of Drinking Water & Sanitation, Ministry of Jal Shakti, in partnership with State governments and local communities.
- Village Water & Sanitation Committees (VWSCs) or Pani Samitis are formed, with at least 50% women members, to plan, implement, manage, and maintain water supply systems.
- Implementation Support Agencies (ISAs) like NGOs and community-based organizations are engaged to facilitate community participation.
- Village Action Plans (VAPs) are prepared for decentralized planning and execution.

### üìà **Achievements / Data** (As of May 2025)
- Over 15.44 crore rural households (79.74%) have been provided with tap water connections.
- 11 States/UTs (Goa, A & N Islands, D&NH & DD, Haryana, Telangana, Puducherry, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Mizoram, and Arunachal Pradesh) have achieved 100% tap water connection for rural households.
- Over 9.27 lakh schools and 9.63 lakh Anganwadi centers have tap water supply.
- Over 24.64 lakh women have been trained to test water samples.
- Significant time-saving for women, who no longer need to spend hours fetching water.
- Potential to prevent nearly 400,000 deaths annually from diarrheal diseases.
