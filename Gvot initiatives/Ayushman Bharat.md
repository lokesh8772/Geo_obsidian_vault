# 📌 Ayushman Bharat

Ayushman Bharat is a flagship scheme of the Government of India aiming to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC). It was launched in line with the recommendations of the National Health Policy 2017 and aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) commitment to "leave no one behind." Ayushman Bharat adopts a continuum of care approach with two main components:

**1. Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs):** These centres are being created by transforming existing Sub Centres and Primary Health Centres to deliver Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC) closer to people's homes. They provide a wide range of services, including maternal and child health, treatment for non-communicable diseases, and free essential drugs and diagnostics.

**2. Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY):** Launched on September 23, 2018, AB-PMJAY is the world's largest health assurance scheme. It aims to provide a health cover of ₹5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization to over 10.74 crore poor and vulnerable families (approximately 50 crore beneficiaries), constituting the bottom 40% of India's population based on the Socio-Economic Caste Census 2011 (SECC 2011). The scheme has since been expanded to include all senior citizens aged 70 years and above, irrespective of their socio-economic status.
