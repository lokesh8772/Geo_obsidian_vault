# 📌 National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)

### 🗓️ **Launch Date**
January 2019

### 🧑‍🏫 **Ministry / Department**
Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC)

### 🎯 **Objective**
The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) is a long-term, time-bound, national-level strategy to tackle the air pollution problem across the country in a comprehensive manner. The key objectives include:
- To augment and evolve an effective and proficient ambient air quality monitoring network across the country, ensuring a comprehensive and reliable database.
- To have efficient data dissemination and public outreach mechanisms for timely measures for prevention and mitigation of air pollution and for inclusive public participation.
- To have a feasible management plan for prevention, control, and reduction of air pollution.
- Initially, the target was to achieve a 20-30% reduction in PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ concentrations by 2024, keeping 2017 as the base year. This target has been revised to a 40% reduction in PM₁₀ levels by 2026.
- For 49 cities benefiting from the XVth Finance Commission air quality grant, the target is a 15% reduction in annual average PM₁₀ concentrations and an increase in the number of good air quality days (AQI < 200).

### 👥 **Target Beneficiaries**
Citizens living in 131 non-attainment cities (cities that did not meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for five consecutive years between 2011-2015) and Million Plus Cities across 24 States and Union Territories.

### 💰 **Features / Components / Assistance**
The NCAP adopts a collaborative, multi-scale, cross-sectoral coordination approach involving various central ministries, state governments, and local bodies. Key features include:
- **Augmenting Air Quality Monitoring Network:** Expanding the network of manual and continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations across the country.
- **City-Specific Action Plans:** Formulation and implementation of city-specific action plans for the 131 non-attainment cities, addressing local sources of pollution. These plans include measures to strengthen monitoring networks, reduce vehicular and industrial emissions, manage dust, control biomass and waste burning, and raise public awareness.
- **PRANA Portal:** A portal for monitoring the implementation of NCAP, tracking the physical and financial status of city action plans and disseminating information to the public.
- **Swachh Vayu Survekshan:** A ranking system for cities based on the policy measures implemented to reduce air pollution.
- **Financial Support:** Funds are provided to the cities through the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and a grant under the 15th Finance Commission, routed through state finance ministries and urban local bodies.
- **Capacity Building and Awareness:** Efforts to enhance public awareness and build the capacity of stakeholders involved in air quality management.
- **Airshed Approach:** Recognizing the transboundary nature of air pollution and promoting coordinated interventions across affected airsheds, particularly in the Indo-Gangetic Plain.

### 📍 **Implementation Details**
- The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) executes the nationwide program within the framework of the NCAP, as per the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.
- Implementation involves inter-sectoral groups, including the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Health, NITI Aayog, and experts from various fields.
- State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) monitor city air quality and publish findings regularly.
- Steering Committees, Monitoring Committees, and Implementation Committees at central and state levels oversee the implementation of city-specific action plans.
- Convergence with other national missions like the National Solar Mission, National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency, and National Mission on Sustainable Habitat is emphasized.

### 📈 **Achievements / Data** (As of November 2024)
- 97 out of 130 cities have shown improvement in air quality in terms of annual PM₁₀ concentrations in FY 2023-24 with respect to the levels of FY 2017-18.
- 55 cities have achieved a reduction of 20% and above in PM₁₀ levels in 2023-24 compared to 2017-18.
- 18 cities have met the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM₁₀ (60 µg/m³) in FY 2023-24.
- The ambient air quality monitoring network has expanded to 1510 stations across 543 cities in 28 states and 7 UTs.
- Focused actions and effective resource convergence have led to air pollution levels declining in 95 cities.
- 51 cities under NCAP have achieved reductions in PM₁₀ levels of over 20%, and 21 cities have reported reductions exceeding 40% compared to the 2017-18 baseline.

- **[[National Urban Livelihoods Mission (NULM)]]:** Addressing livelihoods of the urban poor can indirectly impact their contribution to pollution (e.g., through clean fuel access).

### ⚠️ **Criticism / Challenges / Issues**
- **Slow Progress:** Many cities have failed to meet the initial targets for pollution reduction.
- **Focus on PM₁₀ over PM₂.₅:** Critics argue that the primary focus on coarser PM₁₀ particles neglects the more harmful PM₂.₅ pollutants emitted largely from combustion sources.
- **Underutilization of Funds:** A significant portion of the allocated funds under NCAP and the 15th Finance Commission remains unutilized.
- **Emphasis on Dust Management:** Overwhelming spending on road dust mitigation measures with less focus on controlling emissions from industries, vehicles, and biomass burning.
- **Mismatch in Performance Assessment:** Cities scoring high in PM₁₀ reduction under NCAP may rank low in implementing policy actions under Swachh Vayu Survekshan, and vice versa, indicating a lack of correlation between action and improvement.
- **Limited Focus on Industrial and Vehicular Emissions:** Action plans in cities often do not adequately address industrial emissions located outside municipal boundaries and lack robust strategies for on-road emissions management and vehicle electrification.
- **Weak Enforcement and Capacity Issues:** State Pollution Control Boards and Urban Local Bodies often lack the necessary human resources and training for effective implementation and enforcement of NCAP measures.
- **Data Transparency and Public Availability:** Comprehensive city-wise data on action taken and its impact on air quality is not always readily available.

### ✍️ **Recent Updates / Current Affairs Angle**
- Continued monitoring of the progress towards the revised targets for 2026.
- Emphasis on improving the utilization of funds and focusing on controlling emissions from key combustion sources.
- Efforts to enhance the integration and effectiveness of the Swachh Vayu Survekshan as a performance assessment tool.
- Focus on developing and implementing regional action plans under the airshed approach, particularly for the Indo-Gangetic Plain.
- Discussions and initiatives around strengthening the monitoring of PM₂.₅ levels and making it a primary benchmark for action.
