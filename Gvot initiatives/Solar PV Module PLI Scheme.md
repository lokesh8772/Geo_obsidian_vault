### 🧑‍🏫 **Ministry / Department**
Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE)

### 🎯 **Objective**
To build up solar PV manufacturing capacity of high efficiency modules in India, bring cutting-edge technology, promote integrated plants, develop a local sourcing ecosystem, and reduce import dependence in renewable energy.

### 👥 **Target Beneficiaries**
Solar PV module manufacturers selected through a transparent bidding process under the scheme.

### 💰 **Features / Components / Assistance**
- **Production Linked Incentive (PLI):** Incentive provided for 5 years post-commissioning on the manufacture and sale of high-efficiency solar PV modules.
- **Tranche-I Outlay:** ₹4,500 crore. Incentivized fully integrated manufacturing units.
- **Tranche-II Outlay:** ₹19,500 crore. Incentivizes fully/partially integrated manufacturing units.
- **Technology Agnostic:** Scheme allows all technologies, but better module performance is incentivized.
- **Local Content Linkage:** PLI amount linked to the local content in the manufactured solar PV modules to promote domestic sourcing.

### 📍 **Implementation Details**
- Implemented by MNRE.
- **Tranche-I Implementing Agency:** Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited (IREDA).
- **Tranche-II Implementing Agency:** Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI).
- Selection of manufacturers through a transparent bidding process.
- Manufacturers can set up units anywhere in India.

### 📈 **Achievements / Data**
- **Tranche-I:** Letters of Award issued to 3 successful bidders for setting up 8,737 MW capacity of fully integrated units.
- **Tranche-II:** Letters of Award issued to 11 bidders for setting up 39,600 MW of fully/partially integrated units.
- Total allocated capacity under both tranches: 48,337 MW.
- Expected investment of around ₹93,041 crore from Tranche-II alone.
- Expected to generate over one lakh direct and indirect jobs.
- Domestic solar PV module manufacturing capacity has increased significantly, reaching approximately 70 GW in the past decade.

- [[Make in India]] initiative.
- [[PM-KUSUM]] (Domestic Content Requirement).
- [[CPSU Scheme]] Phase-II (Domestic Content Requirement).
- [[Grid-connected Rooftop Solar Programme]] Phase-II (Domestic Content Requirement).

### ⚠️ **Criticism / Challenges / Issues**
- Scheme is in the gestation period, and funds disbursement was nil as of December 2024.
- Ensuring reasonable pricing of domestic modules and preventing undue advantage of basic customs duty.

### ✍️ **Recent Updates / Current Affairs Angle**
- PM Modi highlighted the PLI scheme as a key driver for the increase in solar PV module manufacturing capacity to 70 GW at India Energy Week 2025 (February 2025).
- Focus on reducing import dependence and promoting local manufacturing in the renewable energy sector.
- Emphasis on achieving 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, with solar being a major contributor.
