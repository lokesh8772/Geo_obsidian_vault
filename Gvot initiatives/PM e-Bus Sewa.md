August 16, 2023 (announced), Payment Security Mechanism notified October 28, 2024.

### 🧑‍🏫 **Ministry / Department**
Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), with support from Ministry of Heavy Industries (MHI) for Payment Security Mechanism.

### 🎯 **Objective**
To augment city bus operations by deploying electric buses (e-buses) on a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model, focusing on cities lacking organized bus services. Aims to promote clean and sustainable urban mobility, reduce noise and air pollution, and generate employment.

### 👥 **Target Beneficiaries**
- Residents of cities with a population of 3 lakh and above (as per Census 2011), including all capital cities of Union Territories, North Eastern Region, and Hill States. Priority given to cities without organized bus services.
- State/City Transport Undertakings (STUs) and private operators participating in the PPP model.

### 💰 **Features / Components / Assistance**
- **Deployment of e-Buses:** Support for operating 10,000 e-buses across eligible cities on a PPP model for 10 years or up to March 2037, whichever is earlier.
- **Central Assistance (CA):** Financial support for bus operations on a per kilometer basis.
- **Infrastructure Development:**
    - 100% CA for creating behind-the-meter power infrastructure (substations, etc.) up to March 2027.
    - Support for the development/upgradation of depot infrastructure.
    - Support for charging infrastructure under Green Urban Mobility Initiatives (GUMI).
- **Payment Security Mechanism (PSM):** A dedicated fund under the Ministry of Heavy Industries to ensure timely payments to e-bus operators in case of default by Public Transport Authorities (PTAs), promoting private sector participation.

### 📍 **Implementation Details**
- Implemented by MoHUA through a challenge method for city selection.
- City proposals are approved by State Level Steering Committees and then by the Central Steering and Sanctioning Committee.
- Demand aggregation and tendering are done by Convergence Energy Services Ltd (CESL).
- Bus operations are the responsibility of States/Cities, with payments made to operators.
- Central Government provides subsidies for operations and infrastructure.
- Payment Security Mechanism (PSM) managed by CESL under MHI.

### 📈 **Achievements / Data**
- Scheme aims to deploy 10,000 e-buses initially.
- Over 169 cities are eligible under Segment A (Augmenting City Bus Services).
- Tenders have been floated for procuring e-buses.
- The Payment Security Mechanism supports the deployment of over 38,000 e-buses in total (including those under PM E-DRIVE).

- [[FAME India Scheme]] (precursor and related scheme for EV adoption).
- [[Green Urban Mobility Initiatives (GUMI).]]
- National Common Mobility Card (NCMC) integration for fare collection.

### ⚠️ **Criticism / Challenges / Issues**
- Success depends on effective PPP implementation and financial viability for operators.
- Ensuring timely payments by PTAs to avoid triggering the PSM.
- Development of adequate charging infrastructure in all selected cities.
- Coordination between central and state/city authorities for smooth implementation.

### ✍️ **Recent Updates / Current Affairs Angle**
- Tenders for e-bus procurement are being floated in various cities.
- Focus on cities without organized bus services initially.
- Integration with the National Common Mobility Card (NCMC) for seamless fare collection.
- Emphasis on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting e-mobility in urban areas.
