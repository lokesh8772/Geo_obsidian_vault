- Focuses especially on women in Low Performing States (LPS) with low institutional delivery rates (Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Assam, Rajasthan, Orissa, and Jammu & Kashmir).
- In High Performing States (HPS), the scheme is available to BPL, Scheduled Caste (SC), and Scheduled Tribe (ST) women.
