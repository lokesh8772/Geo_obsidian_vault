1.  **Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN:**
    -   Make air travel affordable to the masses with fares capped at ‚Çπ2,500 for a one-hour flight.
    -   Revival of unserved and underserved airports through financial support (Viability Gap Funding - VGF).
    -   Concessions from Central and State governments and airport operators to reduce the cost of operations for airlines on RCS routes.
    -   Creation of a Regional Connectivity Fund (RCF) through a levy on certain domestic flights.

2.  **Safety:**
    -   Highest priority to safety with a focus on pre-empting accidents and incidents.
    -   Zero tolerance for safety violations.
    -   Granting administrative and financial autonomy to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).
    -   Implementation of a single-window system for aviation-related transactions through eGCA project.
    -   Implementation of State Safety Programme (SSP) and development of a State Safety Plan.

3.  **Air Transport Operations:**
    -   Promoting the growth of civil air transport operations with a focus on regional connectivity.
    -   Categorization of commercial air transport into Scheduled Air Transport Operator and Scheduled Commuter Operator with graded entry requirements.

4.  **5/20 Rule:**
    -   Replaced the 5/20 rule (requiring 5 years of domestic flying experience and a fleet of 20 aircraft to fly internationally) with a **0/20 rule**.
    -   Allowed all airlines to commence international operations provided they deploy 20 aircraft or 20% of their total capacity (in terms of average number of seats on all departures put together), whichever is higher, for domestic operations.

5.  **Bilateral Traffic Rights:**
    -   Liberalizing bilateral traffic rights to enhance air connectivity.
    -   Entering into 'Open Sky' agreements with SAARC countries and countries within a 5000 km radius on a reciprocal basis.

6.  **Code-Share Agreements:**
    -   Liberalizing domestic code-share points within the framework of Air Service Agreements (ASAs).
    -   Allowing Indian carriers to enter into domestic code-share agreements with foreign carriers to any point in India available under the respective ASA.
    -   Liberalizing international code-share arrangements for designated Indian carriers as per ASA provisions without prior MoCA approval (only intimation required).

7.  **Airports developed by State Govt, Private sector or in PPP mode:**
    -   Encouraging the development of airports by various entities.
    -   Future tariffs at all airports to be calculated on a 'hybrid till' basis unless specified otherwise in concession agreements.
    -   30% of non-aeronautical revenue to be used to cross-subsidize aeronautical charges.
    -   Compensation to Airports Authority of India (AAI) in case a new greenfield airport is approved within a 150 km radius of an existing unsaturated operational AAI airport (not applicable to civil enclaves).

8.  **Air Navigation Services (ANS):**
    -   Modernization of ANS through the implementation of Communication, Navigation, and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) systems.

9.  **Aviation Security, Immigration and Customs:**
    -   Developing 'service delivery modules' for various agencies at airports.
    -   Encouraging the use of private security agencies for non-core security functions.

10. **Helicopters and Charters:**
    -   Rationalizing regulations and airport charges for helicopter operations.
    -   Promoting the use of helicopters for regional connectivity and tourism.

11. **Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO):**
    -   Promoting India as an MRO hub.
    -   Rationalizing taxation and other levies on MRO activities.
    -   Providing adequate land for MRO operations at future airports.

12. **Air-cargo:**
    -   Aiming to grow air cargo volumes significantly.
    -   Streamlining Customs procedures and developing air cargo logistics hubs.

13. **Aeronautical 'Make in India':**
    -   Promoting indigenous manufacturing of aircraft, components, and equipment.

14. **Aviation Education and Skill Development:**
    -   Creating a skilled workforce to support the growth of the aviation sector.
    -   Supporting the Aviation Sector Skill Council and other similar organizations.

### üìç **Implementation Details**
The policy provides a broad framework, with implementation carried out by the Ministry of Civil Aviation, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the Airports Authority of India (AAI), and other relevant stakeholders.
