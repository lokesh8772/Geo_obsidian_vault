### india's strategic opportunities within SCO
1. engaging with central asia and central african republics
2. eco and energy ->  in 2022 kazakhastan produced largest share of Uranium(43%)
3. INSTC
4. dialogue with china and pakistan
### challenges
1. china's efforts to transform it into a china led grouping, promote BRI to have regional prominence
2. expansion(belarus included) -> this expands its acceptance but defeats the initial purpose of confinement to only central asia -> may cause the members to seek other regional forums
3. lack executive effectiveness
4. percieved as anti-western grouping
