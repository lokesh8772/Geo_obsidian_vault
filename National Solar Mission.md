# 📌 National Solar Mission (NSM) / Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM)

### 🗓️ **Launch Date**
11th January 2010

### 🧑‍🏫 **Ministry / Department**
Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE)

### 🎯 **Objective**
To establish India as a global leader in solar energy by creating policy conditions for its large-scale diffusion across the country, aiming for energy security and ecologically sustainable growth. Initially targeted 20 GW by 2022, later revised to 100 GW by 2022.

### 👥 **Target Beneficiaries**
- Utility grid power projects
- Rooftop solar projects
- Off-grid solar applications
- Solar thermal projects
- Solar lighting systems
- Solar parks
- Domestic solar manufacturing sector

### 💰 **Features / Components / Assistance**
- **Phase-wise Targets:** Set targets for grid-connected solar power, off-grid applications, solar thermal collectors, and manufacturing capacity across three phases (2010-2013, 2013-2017, 2017-2022).
- **Financial Support:** Capital subsidies, viability gap funding, generation-based incentives, and concessional financing through IREDA.
- **Policy Framework:** Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) for utilities, preferential tariffs for solar power, and promotion of net metering.
- **Infrastructure Development:** Establishment of solar parks, development of a dedicated transmission grid (Green Energy Corridors).
- **Domestic Manufacturing Push:** Incentives and mandates for using domestically manufactured solar components (cells and modules).
- **R&D and Skill Development:** Focus on research and development to reduce costs and improve efficiency, along with training programs for skilled personnel.

### 📍 **Implementation Details**
- Implemented by MNRE with active participation from State Governments and various agencies like SECI and IREDA.
- Involved public and private sector participation.
- Utilized mechanisms like bundling of solar power with conventional power, viability gap funding for projects.
- Promoted decentralized and off-grid applications for rural electrification.

### 📈 **Achievements / Data**
- India's installed solar capacity has significantly increased from 161 MW in March 2010 to around **107.95 GW** as of April 30, 2025.
- Significant growth in both grid-connected and rooftop solar capacity.
- Establishment of numerous solar parks across the country with a sanctioned capacity of 40 GW (as of March 2024).
- Increased deployment of off-grid solar applications like solar home lights and street lights.
- Development of a domestic solar manufacturing ecosystem, further boosted by schemes like the Solar PV Module PLI.
