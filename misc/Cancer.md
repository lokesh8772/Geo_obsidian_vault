## Russia's mRNA vaccine
1. Show 100% efficiency in clinical trials
2. mRNA vaccine
	1. uses small pieces Messenger RNA to instruct human cells to produce certain types of proteins specific to the virus -> that match up with the parts of pathogens or antigens eg. -> Corona virus...
	2. immune system sees these foreign antigens as invaders -> releases antibody and T-cells(both) -> training immune system for future attacks
3. fully personalized vaccine -> each dose tailored to patient's tumor through mutation profiling
### Benefits
1. production very fast once the virus's genetic sequence is known
2. strong immune response, both(antibody + T-cells)
3. no live virus needed -> eliminate risk of causing disease
### Challenges
1. storage require ultra cold temp -> transportation limitations
2. short-term side effects -> fever, fatigue and soreness at injected area
3. long-term side effects -> as tech is relatively new -> long term side effects are not comprehensively studied yet
4.
