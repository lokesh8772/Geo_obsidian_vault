### Benefits -

1. Na → large availability (made from sea water) → scalable
2. longer lifespan → 3000 charge cycles.
3. Envt. friendly(contains combustible ingredients)
4. ultra fast charging comapred to Li-ion batteries (80% in 6 minutes)
5. stable at temp (range greater than of li-ion)

  

### limitations -

1. non-flexibility, → only cylindrical/prismatic shape
2. charge density lesser
3. tech→ initial stage→ expensive

  

## India -

1. anode instability solved by IITB
2. JNCASR(JN center for advance scientific research) …

  

## Global

1. china → 80% of li-ion battery supply
2. china → 500km range Na-ion based EV battery(NAXTRA)
