# Indian Lunar Exploration Programme (Chandrayaan)

### Launch Date
*   **Chandrayaan-1**: October 22, 2008
*   **Chandrayaan-2**: July 22, 2019
*   **Chandrayaan-3**: July 14, 2023

### Ministry
*   Department of Space (DoS)
*   Executed by: Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)

### Objective
*   **Broad Goal**: Systematic exploration of the Moon.
*   **Scientific**: Detailed mapping of lunar surface, study of minerals, search for water ice.
*   **Technological**: Develop and demonstrate key technologies for interplanetary missions, including soft landing and roving capabilities.

### Key Beneficiaries
*   Global and Indian scientific community.
*   Domestic aerospace industry and technology ecosystem.
*   Academia and students through research opportunities and inspiration.
*   Future space exploration programs.

### Features
*   **Chandrayaan-1**: Orbiter and Moon Impact Probe (MIP).
*   **Chandrayaan-2**: Orbiter, Vikram Lander, and Pragyan Rover.
*   **Chandrayaan-3**: Propulsion Module, Vikram Lander, and Pragyan Rover.
*   **Key Technologies**: Soft landing, robotic roving, in-situ chemical analysis, deep space communication.

### Achievements
*   **Chandrayaan-1**:
    *   Confirmed the presence of water molecules on the Moon's surface.
    *   Made India the 4th country to place its flag on the Moon (via MIP).
*   **Chandrayaan-2**:
    *   Orbiter continues to provide high-resolution data.
*   **Chandrayaan-3**:
    *   First nation to successfully soft-land near the lunar south pole.
    *   Fourth nation to achieve a soft landing on the Moon.
    *   Successfully deployed the Pragyan rover.
    *   Conducted in-situ analysis, confirming elements like Sulphur.

### Related Government Schemes
*   [[Gaganyaan Mission]]
*   [[Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan)]]
*   [[Bharatiya Antariksh Station]]
*   [[Lunar Polar Exploration Mission (LUPEX)]]

### Shortcomings/Criticisms
*   **Chandrayaan-1**: Mission ended prematurely after 312 days (planned for 2 years) due to loss of communication.
*   **Chandrayaan-2**: Failure of the Vikram lander's soft landing attempt due to a last-minute velocity control issue.

### Way Forward
*   **Chandrayaan-4**: Planned as India's first lunar sample-return mission.
*   **LUPEX**: Collaborative mission with Japan (JAXA) to explore the permanently shadowed regions of the lunar pole.
*   Leveraging Chandrayaan's success for the Gaganyaan program and future human lunar missions.

### Recent Updates
*   **August 23, 2023**: Chandrayaan-3's Vikram lander successfully touched down at the 'Shiv Shakti Point' near the lunar south pole.
*   **September 2023**: Pragyan rover completed its primary mission objectives and was put into sleep mode.
*   **September 2024**: Cabinet approved the Chandrayaan-4 mission, aiming to return lunar samples to Earth.
