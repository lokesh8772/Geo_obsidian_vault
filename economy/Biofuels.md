1. produced from biomass like foodgrains, fruits, edible oil, micro-organisms etc
2. they are used in place or in blended form with conventional petroleum fuels
	1. Ethanol Blended Petrol
3. adv
	1. cleaner envt (EBP -> 1 crore liter -> 20,000 Tonnes of CO2)
	2. Reduced imports -> last 10 year, EBP saved 1,10,000 crore of Foreign exchange.
# Generation of Biofuels
1. Edible Feedstock(palm, sugarcane, corn, wheat) -> easy process, cost-effiecient, no intensive pretreatment.
2. Lignocellulogic Biomass and waste -> circular economy, no food vs fuel fuss
3. microalgae and cynobacteria -> direct use of CO2 and no extra use of freshwater.... or land
4. genetically - engineered microorganisms(E-Coli,) -> higher yields, direct use of CO2.
