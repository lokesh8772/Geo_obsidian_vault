## 1. Started - 2020

## 2. Nodal Ministry
Various Ministries depending on the sector (e.g., MeitY for Electronics, DPIIT for others)

## 3. Goal
Boost domestic manufacturing, attract investment, enhance exports, reduce import dependence across key sectors.

## 4. Aim
* Incentivize domestic production through financial support on incremental sales.
* Attract large domestic and foreign investments in manufacturing.
* Enhance India's manufacturing capabilities and global competitiveness.
* Create employment opportunities.
* Promote technological advancements and innovation.
* Develop robust manufacturing ecosystems.

## 5. Initiatives (or Key Features)
* Financial incentives based on incremental sales over a base year (typically 4-6% for 5-6 years).
* Scheme extended to 14 key sectors with a total outlay of â‚¹1.97 lakh crore (over USD 24 billion).
* Sectors include: Mobile Manufacturing & Specified Electronic Components, Pharmaceuticals, Auto & Auto Components, Telecom & Networking Products, Specialty Steel, Textiles & Apparels, Food Products, White Goods, Medical Devices, Electronics, IT Hardware, Advanced Chemistry Cell Battery, Solar PV Modules, Drones.
* Implemented through Project Management Agencies (PMAs).
* Incentives disbursed based on meeting investment and incremental sales thresholds.
* Some sectors include incentives for design-led manufacturing.

## 6. Achievements (if any)
* Investment Realized -> â‚¹1.46 lakh crore (as of August 2024 across 14 sectors).
* Incremental Production/Sales -> â‚¹12.50 lakh crore (as of August 2024 across 14 sectors).
* Employment Generation -> Over 9.5 lakh jobs (as of August 2024 across 14 sectors).
* Exports -> Surpassed â‚¹4 lakh crore (significant contribution from electronics, pharma, food processing).
* Electronics Manufacturing -> Mobile phone exports -> USD 11 Bn (FY 2022-23) vs USD 0.334 Bn (FY 2017-18).
* FDI Increase (Electronics) -> 254% increase.

### Negatives
* Value Addition Concerns -> Some sectors (e.g., mobile manufacturing) face criticism for primarily focusing on assembly with limited domestic value addition.
* Import Dependence for Components -> Continues in several sectors (e.g., electronics components).
* Incentive Disbursal Clarity -> Concerns raised about the transparency and standardization of incentive allocation.
* WTO Constraints -> Limits on linking subsidies directly to domestic value addition.

## 7. Any Significant Development in Current
* PLI Budget Increased -> Electronics & IT Hardware to â‚¹9,000 crore (from â‚¹5,777 crore RE 2024-25).
* PLI Budget Increased -> Automobiles & Auto Components to â‚¹2,818.85 crore (from â‚¹346.87 crore RE 2024-25).
* PLI Scheme 1.1 for Specialty Steel launched (January 2025).
* 42 MoUs signed under PLI Scheme 1.1 for Specialty Steel with 25 companies (March 2025).
