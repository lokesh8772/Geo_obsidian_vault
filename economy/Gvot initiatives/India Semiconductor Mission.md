# üìå India Semiconductor Mission (ISM)

### üóìÔ∏è **Launch Date**
December 2021

### üßë‚Äçüè´ **Ministry / Department**
Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)

### üéØ **Objective**
The India Semiconductor Mission (ISM) aims to build a vibrant semiconductor and display ecosystem in India to establish the nation as a global hub for electronics manufacturing and design. Key objectives include:

-   Formulating a long-term strategy for developing sustainable semiconductor and display manufacturing facilities and a semiconductor design ecosystem.
-   Facilitating the adoption of trusted electronics through a secure semiconductor and display supply chain.
-   Enabling multi-fold growth of the Indian semiconductor design industry.
-   Promoting indigenous Intellectual Property (IP) generation.
-   Encouraging and incentivizing Transfer of Technologies (ToT).
-   Establishing mechanisms to harness economies of scale in the Indian semiconductor and display industry.
-   Enabling cutting-edge research and development in semiconductors and display technologies.
-   Fostering collaborations and partnerships with national and international entities.

### üë• **Target Beneficiaries**
Companies involved in semiconductor and display manufacturing, design firms, startups, research institutions, academia, and the broader electronics manufacturing ecosystem in India.

### üí∞ **Key Components and Initiatives:**
The India Semiconductor Mission is the nodal agency for the efficient, coherent, and smooth implementation of the Programme for Development of Semiconductors and Display Manufacturing Ecosystem in India, which has a total outlay of ‚Çπ76,000 crore. The key schemes under this programme are:

1.  **Scheme for setting up of Semiconductor Fabs in India:** Provides fiscal support of up to 50% of the project cost on a pari-passu basis for eligible applicants.
2.  **Scheme for setting up of Display Fabs in India:** Offers fiscal support of up to 50% of the project cost on a pari-passu basis to approved applicants for setting up TFT LCD / AMOLED based display fabrication facilities.
3.  **Scheme for setting up of Compound Semiconductors / Silicon Photonics / Sensors (including MEMS) Fabs and Semiconductor ATMP / OSAT facilities in India:** Extends fiscal support of 50% of capital expenditure to eligible applicants.
4.  **Design Linked Incentive (DLI) Scheme:** Provides financial incentives and design infrastructure support across various stages of semiconductor design development and deployment.

### üìç **Implementation Details**
The India Semiconductor Mission (ISM) has been set up as an independent business division within the Digital India Corporation, with administrative and financial autonomy. It is led by global experts in the semiconductor and display industries and serves as the nodal agency for implementing the schemes.

### üìà **Achievements / Data** (As of May 2025)
-   **Six semiconductor units approved:** Including a joint venture between HCL and Foxconn in Uttar Pradesh for display driver chips.
-   **Five semiconductor units in advanced stages of construction.**
-   **Significant investments attracted:** Including ‚Çπ3,700 crore for the HCL-Foxconn unit.
-   **Fiscal Support Agreements signed:** With Tata Electronics and Tata Semiconductor Manufacturing for a semiconductor facility in Dholera, Gujarat.
-   **Ecosystem Development:** Major equipment manufacturers like Applied Materials and Lam Research, and gas and chemical suppliers like Merck, Linde, and Air Liquide, are establishing or expanding their presence in India.
-   **Design Capabilities Enhanced:** Over 270 academic institutions and 70 startups are engaged in semiconductor design, with student-developed products being taped out by SCL Mohali.
-   **International Collaborations:** MoUs signed with Singapore, EU, and Japan on semiconductor supply chain partnerships. Collaboration with Lam Research and IISc on R&D.
-   **Skilled Workforce Development:** Programme being implemented across 113 academic institutions, R&D centers, startups, and MSMEs to train 85,000 engineers in VLSI and related fields.
-   **Progress in ATMP/OSAT Facilities:** Renesas Electronics, in collaboration with CG Power and Stars Microelectronics, is on track to complete its pilot OSAT facility by July 2025.

### üß© **Linkages / Related Schemes**
-   **[[Digital India Programme]]:** ISM operates under the Digital India Corporation.
-   **[[Make in India]] & [[Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan]]:** ISM aims to reduce import dependence and boost domestic manufacturing.
-   **[[Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme]]s:** The semiconductor schemes are a part of the broader PLI initiative.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Criticism / Challenges / Issues**
-   High initial costs and long gestation periods for setting up manufacturing facilities.
-   Need for continuous skill development in a rapidly evolving industry.
-   Competition from established global semiconductor hubs.
-   Ensuring a stable and reliable supply chain ecosystem.

### ‚úçÔ∏è **Recent Updates / Current Affairs Angle**
-   Cabinet approval for the sixth semiconductor unit in Uttar Pradesh (HCL-Foxconn JV) in May 2025.
-   Continued progress in the construction of previously approved semiconductor units.
-   Focus on skilling initiatives and international collaborations to strengthen the ecosystem.
-   Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) providing additional land for semiconductor projects.
- [[Semiconductor Project approval]]
