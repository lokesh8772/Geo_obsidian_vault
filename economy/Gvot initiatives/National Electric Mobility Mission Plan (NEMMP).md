### üóìÔ∏è **Launch Date**
2013

### üßë‚Äçüè´ **Ministry / Department**
Ministry of Heavy Industries

### üéØ **Objective**
To set the vision and roadmap for the large-scale adoption and manufacturing of electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid vehicles in India by 2020. It aimed to achieve national fuel security by promoting electric mobility, reducing vehicular emissions, and developing domestic manufacturing capabilities.

### üë• **Target Beneficiaries**
- Electric and hybrid vehicle manufacturers
- Battery manufacturers
- Charging infrastructure providers
- Consumers adopting electric and hybrid vehicles
- Research and development institutions in the automotive sector

### üí∞ **Features / Components / Assistance**
- **Demand Creation:** Incentivizing the purchase of EVs and hybrids through schemes like FAME India.
- **Technology Development:** Supporting research and development in EV and hybrid technologies, battery technology, and charging infrastructure.
- **Charging Infrastructure Development:** Encouraging the establishment of public and private charging infrastructure across the country.
- **Supply Side Development:** Promoting domestic manufacturing of EVs, batteries, and other components through policy support and incentives.
- **Skill Development:** Creating a skilled workforce to support the EV ecosystem.
- **Pilot Projects:** Implementing pilot projects to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of electric mobility.

### üìç **Implementation Details**
- Developed and overseen by the Ministry of Heavy Industries.
- Implementation through various agencies and schemes, notably the FAME India scheme.
- Involved collaboration with other government ministries, state governments, industry stakeholders, and research institutions.
- Phased approach with targets set for different stages of adoption and manufacturing.

### üìà **Achievements / Data**
- The NEMMP 2020 laid the foundation for EV adoption in India.
- It led to the formulation and implementation of the FAME India scheme, which provided demand incentives and supported charging infrastructure.
- Increased awareness and interest in electric mobility among consumers and industry.
- Growth in the domestic EV manufacturing sector, although significant import dependence remains for certain components like battery cells.
- Development of some charging infrastructure, though still limited compared to the need.
- Research and development activities in EV technologies have been initiated.

### üß© **Linkages / Related Schemes**
- [[FAME India Scheme]] (the primary scheme to implement NEMMP 2020's demand creation component)
- [[Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme]] for Automobile and Auto Component Industry
- PLI Scheme for Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Storage
- [[PM E-DRIVE Scheme]]
- [[PM e-Bus Sewa]]

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Criticism / Challenges / Issues**
- The targets set under NEMMP 2020 were not fully achieved by the target year.
- Slow initial adoption of EVs due to factors like high upfront costs, limited charging infrastructure, and range anxiety.
- Dependence on imports for key EV components, particularly battery cells.
- Need for more robust and standardized charging infrastructure.
- Ensuring the quality and safety of domestically manufactured EVs.

### ‚úçÔ∏è **Recent Updates / Current Affairs Angle**
- While NEMMP 2020 was the guiding framework until 2020, the focus has now shifted to achieving the broader goals outlined in subsequent policies and schemes like FAME-II and the PLI schemes.
- The vision of NEMMP 2020 continues to influence India's electric mobility strategy, with a greater emphasis on indigenous manufacturing, battery technology development, and charging infrastructure expansion under the current initiatives.
- The ongoing efforts under schemes like FAME and PLI are essentially carrying forward and building upon the foundation laid by NEMMP 2020, with revised targets and strategies for a more accelerated adoption of electric vehicles.
