# National Bioenergy Programme

## 1. Started - 2022 (continuation of previous efforts)

## 2. Nodal Ministry
Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), Government of India

## 3. Goal
To promote the utilization of biomass, cattle dung, industrial and urban biowaste for energy recovery, thereby contributing to clean energy, rural development, waste management, and energy security. To make bioenergy a significant contributor to India's energy mix.

## 4. Aim
* To support the setting up of projects for the generation of Biogas, BioCNG, and power from urban, industrial, and agricultural wastes/residues.
* To support the manufacturing of briquettes and pellets for use in power generation.
* To promote biomass (non-bagasse) based cogeneration in industries.
* To support the setting up of family and medium-size biogas plants in rural areas for clean cooking fuel, lighting, and meeting thermal and small power needs.
* To reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
* To improve sanitation and empower women in rural areas.
* To create rural employment and provide an additional source of income for farmers.
* To promote a circular economy by converting waste into energy and bio-manure.
* To reduce the import of natural gas and crude oil and provide a buffer against price fluctuations.

## 5. Initiatives (or Key Features)
* **Waste to Energy Programme:** Supports the establishment of large Biogas, BioCNG, and power plants based on urban, industrial, and agricultural wastes.
* **Biomass Programme:** Focuses on supporting the manufacturing of briquettes and pellets for power generation and promoting non-bagasse-based cogeneration in industries. This aligns with the National Mission on Co-firing of Biomass in Thermal Power Plants to reduce stubble burning.
* **Biogas Programme:** Supports the setting up of family and medium-size biogas plants in rural areas through financial assistance.
* **Central Financial Assistance (CFA):** Provides financial support for setting up bioenergy projects, including both bank-financed and self-funded projects. Higher CFA is available for special category states and Gaushalas/Shelters.
* **SATAT Initiative:** The BioCNG component supports the Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) initiative of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, aiming to set up 5000 BioCNG plants.
* **GOBAR-DHAN Scheme:** Integrates with the Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources Dhan (GOBAR-DHAN) scheme under Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) for setting up community/cluster-level biogas plants.
* **Bio-Urja Portal:** A single-window platform for registration and online application for CFA for Waste to Energy, Biomass, and non-bagasse cogeneration projects.
* **Biogas Portal:** Provides comprehensive information related to biogas.
* **R&D Support:** Encouraging research and development in biomass-to-green hydrogen and other advanced bioenergy technologies.
* **Skill Development:** Focus on creating a skilled workforce for the bioenergy sector.

## 6. Achievements (if any)
* Commissioning of several BioCNG plants and a significant number of small biogas plants across the country. As of August 2023, 6 BioCNG plants and over 11,100 small biogas plants were commissioned under the programme.
* Establishment of numerous Waste to Energy projects at various stages of implementation, including Biogas, BioCNG, and Power generation plants. As of January 2023, 90 Waste to Energy projects were under implementation.
* Supported briquetting and pelletization plants with a capacity of around 400 tonnes.
* Increased yearly allocation of Green Ammonia for the fertiliser sector to 750,000 tonnes to meet rising demand (as of June 2024), indicating the role of bioenergy in producing green hydrogen/ammonia.
* Development and launch of the Biourja and Biogas portals to facilitate project development and information dissemination.

## 7. Any Significant Development in Current
* The National Bioenergy Programme is currently in its Phase-I, which runs from FY 2021-22 to 2025-26, with a budget outlay of ₹858 crore. Phase-II is under discussion with a likely outlay of another ₹857 crore.
* Focus on expediting the flow of financial assistance for the second phase of the programme.
* Emphasis on converting biowaste materials like agricultural waste, animal dung, sugarcane bagasse, and Municipal Solid Waste into higher-value products like Green Hydrogen, Methanol, and Syngas.
* Advancing the "Biomass-to-Green Hydrogen" initiative under the National Green Hydrogen Mission, with support for R&D projects in this area.
* Continued efforts to address potential barriers in the bioenergy sector, such as feedstock logistics, financing gaps, and regulatory coordination.
* Ongoing promotion of the Bio-Urja portal as a streamlined solution for project applicants.
