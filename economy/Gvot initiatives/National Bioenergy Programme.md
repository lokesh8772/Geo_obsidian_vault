# National Bioenergy Programme

## 1. Started
- **Notified:** November 2, 2022
- **Implementation Period (Phase-I):** Financial Year (FY) 2021-22 to 2025-26

## 2. Nodal Ministry
- Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), Government of India

## 3. Goal
- Utilize surplus biomass, cattle dung, and urban/industrial biowaste for energy recovery.
- Contribute to clean energy, reduce import dependency, create rural income, and manage waste.

## 4. Aim
- Support projects generating Biogas, Compressed Bio-Gas (BioCNG), and power from waste.
- Promote manufacturing of briquettes and pellets from biomass.
- Support rural family-sized and medium-sized biogas plants.
- Reduce greenhouse gas emissions and stubble burning.
- Boost rural employment and farmer income.

## 5. Initiatives (Key Features)
- **Three Sub-schemes:**
    - **Waste to Energy Programme:** For large Biogas, BioCNG, and power plants from urban, industrial, and agricultural waste.
    - **Biomass Programme:** For manufacturing briquettes/pellets and supporting non-bagasse cogeneration.
    - **Biogas Programme:** For family and medium-sized rural biogas plants.
- **Central Financial Assistance (CFA):** Provides subsidies for setting up projects, with higher assistance for special category states and Gaushalas.
- **Supporting Schemes:** Aligns with Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) and Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources Dhan (GOBAR-DHAN) initiatives.
- **Digital Portals:** Biourja and Biogas portals for streamlined registration and information.

## 6. Achievements
- **Installed Capacity (as of April 2025):**
    - **Waste to Energy:** 711.29 Megawatt equivalent (MWeq)
    - **Biomass Power:** 10,743 Megawatts (MW)
- Successful commissioning of numerous Biogas/BioCNG plants and briquetting/pellet plants across the country.

## 7. Significant Current Developments
- **Phase-I Implementation:** Actively running from 2021-22 to 2025-26 with a budget of â‚¹858 crore.
- **Revised Guidelines (June 2025):** The MNRE has simplified guidelines for the Biomass and Waste to Energy programmes to promote ease of doing business.
    - Simplified documentation and approval processes.
    - Introduced flexible, Internet of Things (IoT)-based monitoring instead of expensive Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems.
    - Removed requirement for long-term sale contracts for briquette/pellet manufacturers, allowing for more market flexibility.
- **Future Focus:** Emphasis on converting biowaste to high-value products like Green Hydrogen and Methanol, in line with the National Green Hydrogen Mission.
