Recently highlighted by Parliamentary standing committe.

india - 
1. 53 indigenous cattle breeds
2. 21 indigenous buffalo breeds
3. Productivity
	1. cattle -> 3.54 kg/day
	2. buffalo -> 5.92 kg/day
4. Israel -> 37 kg/day
5. USA -> 30 kg/day

### Reasons
1. low Artificial Insemination Coverage -> only 30% of total breedable bovines
2. AI technicians shortage -> required -> 2 lakh , have -> 1.16 lakh
3. scalability issue -> > 80% of low producing indigenous animals reared by small and marginal farmers, landless labourers
### Recommendations
1. Revision of Selection Criteria for conservation purposes -
	1. breeds having a minimum of 50,000 numbers -> sufficient data + more survival chances in case of diseases.
2. Inclusive breed improvement Program -> 
	1. breed improvement programmes that are often funded by the govt should include state dominant breeds, rather than mix/foreign breeds of lesser numbers, resilience(climate, local diseases), high maintenance -> sustainability
3. accountability -> 
	1. for semen stations -> that fails to provide adequate quality and quantity of semen, -> economic loss to farmers
4. Sex-Sorted semen -> to reproduce only female calves -> more economic value than male calves
5.
