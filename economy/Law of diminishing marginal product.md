if we keep increasing the employment of a certain input in the production, while keeping the other inputs intact, -> after a certain point the marginal productivity starts falling.

Marginal productivity means the addition in production upon adding unit input into the production

similar law -> Law of variable proportions -> the marginal productivity of an input initially rises, then it falls.
