[[GST]]
2025-09-07
Total 2 slabs of GST -> 5% and 18%.
1. daily use essentials -> milk, chapati, paneer -> 0%
2. toiletries, farm tools, medicine, bicycles -> 5%
3. consumer goods - AC, TV, Small cars -> 18%
4. sin goods -> tobacco, luxury cars, aerated drinks, alcohol -> 40%

5. support for agri industry(reduced tax on farm tools), Renewable energy sectors(equipments), Automobile parts.
6. fixed Inverted duty structure problem from multiple sectors

7. Operationalization of GST Appellate Tribunal
## challenges
1. revenue foregone of 48,000 crore -> finance min
2. ITC removed from certain categories -> this could lead to higher costs for producers/sellers if input cost is high -> increase in prices for offsetting losses.
3. in cases where input is taxed higher and output is lower(IDS) -> speedy claims are to be established but not for all categories (only for those having structural problems, and not just because of rate cuts) -> Unclaimable credit accumulation -> cost increases -> price increase
