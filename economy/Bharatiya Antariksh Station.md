### Launch Date
*   **First Module (BAS-1)**: 2028
*   **Fully Operational**: 2035

### Ministry
*   Department of Space (DoS)
*   Executed by: Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)

### Objective
*   Establish India's own orbiting laboratory for scientific research.
*   Conduct advanced experiments in microgravity (life sciences, materials science).
*   Enhance long-duration human spaceflight capability.
*   Serve as a stepping stone for future interplanetary missions.

### Key Beneficiaries
*   Indian scientific and academic research community.
*   Startups and entrepreneurs in the space technology sector.
*   Domestic high-tech manufacturing and allied industries.
*   Students and youth, through inspiration in STEM fields.

### Features
*   **Modular Design**: Composed of five distinct modules.
*   **Orbit**: Low Earth Orbit at an altitude of 400-450 km.
*   **Mass**: Approximately 52 tonnes upon completion.
*   **Crew Capacity**: Nominal crew of 3-4 astronauts.
*   **Indigenous Systems**: Bharat Docking System, indigenously developed life support systems.
*   **Robotics**: Will feature a robotic arm for external operations.

### Achievements
*   Design and configuration finalized.
*   Model of the space station unveiled (August 2025).
*   Union Cabinet approval secured for the development of the first module.

### Related Government Schemes
*   [[Gaganyaan Mission]]
*   [[Chandrayaan Programme]]
*   [[Next Generation Launch Vehicle (NGLV)]]

### Shortcomings/Criticisms
*   **High Financial Cost**: Requires significant and sustained funding.
*   **Technological Complexity**: Major challenges in developing reliable life support and in-orbit assembly systems.
*   **Space Debris Risk**: Poses a significant threat to the station's operational safety.
*   **Geostrategic Competition**: Navigating the competitive and political landscape of space exploration.

### Way Forward
*   Launch of the first module (BAS-1) by 2028 on an LVM3 vehicle.
*   Remaining modules to be launched by 2035 using the Next Generation Launch Vehicle (NGLV).
*   Human operations to commence after 2035.
*   Foster international collaborations and private sector involvement.

### Recent Updates
*   **September 2024**: Union Cabinet approved the extension of the Gaganyaan program to include the development of the first module of the BAS.
*   **August 2025**: A model of the Bharatiya Antariksh Station was unveiled during National Space Day celebrations.
