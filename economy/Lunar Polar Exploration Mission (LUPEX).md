# Lunar Polar Exploration Mission (LUPEX)

### Launch Date
*   Planned for 2028â€“2029

### Ministry
*   Joint mission by:
    *   Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), India
    *   Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), Japan

### Objective
*   Explore the lunar south pole for water ice.
*   Quantify water resources and analyze their quality.
*   Investigate feasibility of using lunar resources for sustainable exploration.
*   Demonstrate technologies for lunar night survival and surface mobility.

### Key Beneficiaries
*   Global scientific community.
*   Future crewed and robotic lunar missions (e.g., Artemis Program).
*   Space agencies involved (ISRO, JAXA, NASA, ESA).

### Features
*   **Collaboration**: ISRO provides the lander; JAXA provides the H3 launch vehicle and the rover.
*   **Rover**: Heavy-duty rover (~350 kg) with instruments from ISRO, JAXA, NASA, and ESA.
*   **Payload**: Equipped with a drill to collect subsurface samples (up to 1.5 meters).
*   **Duration**: Planned for a surface mission of up to 100 days.
*   **Target Area**: Permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) near the lunar south pole.

### Achievements
*   Mission concept and feasibility studies completed.
*   Formally approved by both Indian and Japanese governments.
*   Preliminary design phase is underway.

### Related Government Schemes
*   [[Indian Lunar Exploration Programme (Chandrayaan)]]
*   [[Gaganyaan Mission]]
*   [[Artemis Accords]]

### Shortcomings/Criticisms
*   **Technical Challenges**: Landing and operating in the extreme cold and darkness of PSRs.
*   **Complex Coordination**: Inherent difficulties in managing a joint international mission.
*   **Timeline**: Mission timelines have been subject to revision.

### Way Forward
*   Finalize lander and rover designs.
*   Complete hardware development and integration.
*   Select a final landing site in the south polar region.
*   Proceed with launch and surface operations.

### Recent Updates
*   **March 2025**: India's Union Cabinet formally approved the mission.
*   **May 2025**: The mission has entered the preliminary design phase after instrument selections were finalized.
