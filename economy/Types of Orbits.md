# Key Points: Orbits of Satellites

## 1. Low Earth Orbit (LEO)
- **Altitude:** 160 km to 1,000 km above Earth's surface
- **Orbital Period:** 88–127 minutes (about 16 revolutions per day)
- **Features:** High orbital speed, close proximity to Earth, smaller coverage area
- **Applications:** Earth observation, remote sensing, scientific missions, ISS, many communication constellations

## 2. Medium Earth Orbit (MEO)
- **Altitude:** 2,000 km to 35,786 km
- **Orbital Period:** 2–24 hours
- **Features:** Larger coverage than LEO, used for navigation
- **Applications:** Navigation satellites (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, NavIC), communications

## 3. Geostationary/Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO/GSO)
- **Altitude:** 35,786 km (geostationary) above the equator
- **Orbital Period:** 24 hours (matches Earth's rotation)
- **Features:** Appears stationary over one point, covers one-third of Earth's surface
- **Applications:** Communication satellites, meteorology, weather monitoring, TV broadcasting

## 4. Polar Orbit
- **Path:** Passes above/close to both poles; inclined at ~90°
- **Features:** Entire Earth can be scanned over time as Earth rotates below
- **Applications:** Earth observation, environmental monitoring, reconnaissance

## 5. Sun-Synchronous Orbit (SSO)
- **Type:** Special polar orbit
- **Features:** Passes over the same part of Earth at the same local solar time; useful for consistent lighting conditions
- **Applications:** Remote sensing, climate studies, environmental monitoring

## 6. Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO)
- **Altitude:** Perigee (closest point) low, apogee (farthest point) very high
- **Features:** Long dwell time over specific regions, especially high-latitude
- **Applications:** Communications for high-latitude countries, certain scientific missions

## 7. Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO)
- **Type:** Transitional
- **Features:** Elliptical orbit used to move satellites from LEO to GEO
- **Applications:** Satellite positioning (launch phase)
