# Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan)

### Launch Date
*   **Launch**: November 5, 2013
*   **Mars Orbit Insertion**: September 24, 2014

### Ministry
*   Department of Space (DoS)
*   Executed by: Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)

### Objective
*   **Primary**: Demonstrate technology for interplanetary missions.
*   **Secondary**: Explore Mars' surface features, morphology, mineralogy, and atmosphere.
*   Search for methane, a potential indicator of life.

### Key Beneficiaries
*   Indian scientific and planetary research community.
*   Students and academia through inspiration and data access.
*   The nation, via enhanced technological prestige and global standing.

### Features
*   **Launch Vehicle**: Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C25).
*   **Payload Mass**: 15 kg.
*   **Scientific Instruments (5 total)**:
    *   Mars Color Camera (MCC)
    *   Thermal Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (TIS)
    *   Methane Sensor for Mars (MSM)
    *   Mars Exospheric Neutral Composition Analyser (MENCA)
    *   Lyman Alpha Photometer (LAP)

### Achievements
*   First nation to succeed in a Mars mission on the first attempt.
*   First Asian nation to reach Mars orbit.
*   Most cost-effective Mars mission globally (approx. $74 million).
*   Mission life far exceeded its planned six months, operating for nearly eight years.
*   Generated over 1,000 scientific publications and a Mars Atlas.

### Related Government Schemes
*   [[Mars Orbiter Mission 2 (Mangalyaan-2)]]
*   [[Chandrayaan Programme]]
*   [[Gaganyaan Mission]]

### Shortcomings/Criticisms
*   Limited scientific payload (15 kg) compared to other Mars missions.
*   Use of a less powerful PSLV rocket limited the spacecraft's capabilities and orbital parameters.
*   Viewed by some critics as a "spectacle" rather than a mission driven purely by science.

### Way Forward
*   Mission concluded in April 2022 after losing communication with the spacecraft.
*   Data collected continues to be analyzed by scientists.
*   Paved the way for future, more advanced interplanetary missions, including a planned Mars lander.
*   ISRO is planning a follow-up, Mangalyaan-2, likely to feature a larger orbiter and potentially a lander/rover.

### Recent Updates
*   **October 2022**: ISRO officially declared the mission over after communication was lost, likely due to propellant and battery depletion.
*   The mission is celebrated for its longevity and for serving as a critical technology demonstrator.
