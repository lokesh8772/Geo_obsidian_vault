1. AI - driven analysis for optimal location of infra -> check dams, ponds....
2. Drone -> automated inspection and early detection of potential leaks and weak areas in infra.
3. IoT sensors => real time monitoring of water quality and water usage -> reduce wastage.
4. micro-irrigation tech-> drip ... -> efficiency
5. block chain -> immutable ledger -> transparent, secure and efficient way to track water quality and usage..
6. UV treatment and membrane bioReactors.. -> high tech water treatment.

### India -
1. GIS -> monitoring of minor irrigation project
2. Real Time data acquisition system(RTDAS) -> under National Hydrology Mission, for monitoring surface and ground water levels.
3. India-Groundwater Resource Estimation System -> by Central Ground Water Board.
4. data from satellites like GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment)
