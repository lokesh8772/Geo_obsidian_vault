Issues
1. lack of synergy b/w CGWB, CPCB, SPCBs, and MoJS
2. water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974 scarcely covers ground water... implementation...
3. Poor monitoring
4. ....(over extraction, waste treatment...)

Recommendations
1. Legal
	1. empower CGWB to control the quality and quantity of extraction
	2. make a Framework(GWP control fra..) for coordinated action
2. monitoring...
	1. real time monitoring and early warning systems...
	2. integrate ground water quality with Public health surveillance
3. Targeted 
	1. arsenic and fluoride removal plants in mining and fluoride prone areas respectively
4. Agriculture
	1. [[Soil Health Card Scheme|Soil Health Card]]
	2. organic farming
5. Industrial 
	1. Zero Liquid Waste policy.
	2. waste treatment standards and implementation
6. community engagement
	1. water user groups,
