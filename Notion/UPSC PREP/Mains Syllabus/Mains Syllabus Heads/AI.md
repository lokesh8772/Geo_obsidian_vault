## Challenges -

1. Job loss to low skilled labour
2. IPR issues, demotivating noval creation
3. economic gap between rich and poor and social gap b/w educated and un-educated.
4. increased Frauds, personal identity theft, propaganda, national security
5. deepfakes creating narratives, influencing common people → …. outcomes
6. High cost of GPUs
7. Regualtory concern, most of the leading AI companies are foreigners,
8. Environmental concern → high energy required for running and cooling the GPUs and data centers.

  

## Way forward -

1. skill development, integrate AI in curricula(school - college)
2. Regulatory norms clear and strict, inspiration → EU’s (General AI rules)?
3. Ai integration in public security institution for better identification , surveillandce, assessment and disposal of threats.
4. R&D for energy efficient models(ex deepseek), for domestic mfg of GPUs.
