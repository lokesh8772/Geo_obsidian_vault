### Context

Center asked commerce plateforms not to wait for Central Consumer protection Authority to intervene and actively recognize dark patterns and eliminate them

  

### Issues

Dark patterns are techniques used by online plateforms to mislead the consumer/customer to make wrong choices or effect their choices

  

### Components

1. false urgency
2. not revealing full price components early
3. subscription → termination imposssible or hidden or tediuos
4. unnecessary request for data concent
5. inclusion of items in the basket, as part of offers(forcing to buy to avail offer)
6. promoting/ mandating certain services for users(amazon pay→ increased discounts)
7. interface inference(ex. “NO” in bg maching color)
8. creating fear, shame,guilt to make person do/purchase something
