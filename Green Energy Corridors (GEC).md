## 1. Started - 2015 (Phase I), 2021-22 (Phase II - InSTS), 2023 (Phase II - ISTS Ladakh)

## 2. Nodal Ministry
Ministry of Power (MoP) and Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), Government of India

## 3. Goal
To synchronize electricity produced from renewable energy sources (like solar and wind) with conventional power stations in the grid, and to facilitate the evacuation and integration of large-scale renewable energy into the national grid.

## 4. Aim
* To build a dedicated transmission infrastructure for large-scale renewable energy projects.
* To integrate and evacuate approximately 24 GW of renewable energy under Phase I and an additional 20 GW under Phase II (InSTS) from resource-rich states.
* To establish an Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) for evacuating 13 GW of renewable energy from Ladakh.
* To improve grid stability and reduce transmission losses.
* To support the achievement of India's renewable energy targets (e.g., 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030).
* To promote ecologically sustainable growth by reducing the carbon footprint.
* To enhance energy security by diversifying the energy mix.

## 5. Initiatives (or Key Features)
* **Phase I (Intra-State Transmission System - InSTS-I):**
    * Implementation in eight renewable-rich states: Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh.
    * Targeted to evacuate approximately 24 GW of renewable energy.
    * Involved setting up approximately 9,700 ckm of transmission lines and 22,600 MVA of substations.
    * Funding mechanism: 40% Central Financial Assistance (CFA), 40% loan (from KfW Germany), and 20% State Government equity.
* **Phase II (Intra-State Transmission System - InSTS-II):**
    * Implementation in seven states: Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh.
    * Targeted to evacuate approximately 20 GW of renewable energy.
    * Involves setting up approximately 10,750 ckm of transmission lines and 27,500 MVA of substations.
    * Funding mechanism: 33% Central Financial Assistance (CFA), and the remaining to be arranged by State Transmission Utilities (STUs), potentially through loans from IREDA/REC/PFC/KfW.
* **Phase II (Inter-State Transmission System - ISTS for Ladakh):**
    * Project to evacuate 13 GW of renewable energy from Ladakh.
    * Includes setting up approximately 1,268 ckm of transmission lines and two 5 GW HVDC terminals (at Pang, Ladakh and Kaithal, Haryana).
    * Implementing agency: Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (POWERGRID).
    * Scheduled for completion by FY 2029-30.
    * Central Financial Assistance (CFA) of 40% of the project cost.
* **Renewable Energy Management Centres (REMCs):** Establishment of REMCs at national, regional, and state levels to facilitate the integration of variable renewable energy sources into the grid.
* **Reactive Compensation and Energy Storage Systems:** Deployment of these technologies to enhance grid stability.
* **Inter-state and Intra-state Transmission Lines and Substations:** Building the necessary infrastructure to transfer renewable power from generation sites to demand centers.

## 6. Achievements (if any)
* **Phase I:** Approximately 9,135 ckm of transmission lines constructed and 21,313 MVA of substations charged as of October 2024. Projects completed in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu.
* **Phase II (InSTS):** Tendering process underway by the State Transmission Utilities in the seven implementing states.
* **Phase II (ISTS Ladakh):** Land acquired at Pang, HVDC tender issued (expected award by March 2025), and LiDAR survey initiated as of December 2024/March 2025.
* REMCs commissioned at 11 locations.
* Facilitated the integration of a significant amount of renewable energy into the grid, contributing to India's clean energy transition.

## 7. Any Significant Development in Current
* **Extension of Timelines:** Phase I completion timelines extended for some states due to right-of-way issues and environmental concerns.
* **Focus on Completion of Phase I & II (InSTS):** Efforts underway to expedite the implementation of ongoing projects.
* **Advancement of Ladakh ISTS Project:** Significant progress in land acquisition and tendering for the HVDC transmission system.
* **Budget Allocation:** Significant fund allocation of â‚¹6 billion under Union Budget 2025-26 for GEC projects.
* **Planning for Phase III:** The power ministry is reportedly working on the next phase of the Green Energy Corridors.
* **Cross-border Interconnections:** Exploring potential for cross-border renewable energy corridors (e.g., with Singapore).
* **Integration with "One Sun, One World, One Grid" initiative.**
