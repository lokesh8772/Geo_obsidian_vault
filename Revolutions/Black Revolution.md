1. Need

- Energy security post-1947 independence

- Industrial development requirements

- Reduce foreign oil dependency

- Forex conservation

2. History

- Started: 1960s

- First oil discovery: Digboi, Assam (1889)

- ONGC established: 1956

- Major boost: 1974 (Bombay High discovery)

- Oil production: 0.25 MMT (1947) → 32 MMT (1989)

3. Key Developments

- Refineries built:

  • 1954: Mumbai (first post-independence)

  • 1957: Guwahati

  • 1962: Barauni

  • 1965: Koyali

- Production milestones:

  • 1974: Bombay High (38 million tonnes/year)

  • 1989: Krishna-Godavari Basin

  • 2002: Rajasthan fields

- Infrastructure:

  • Pipeline network: 10,000+ km by 1990

  • Storage capacity: 45 MMT by 2000

4. Results (with data)

- Import dependence: 100% (1970) → 70% (1990) -> 88%(2024)

- Employment: 2 million+ jobs (direct + indirect)

- Revenue contribution: ₹18,000 crore (1990)

- PSUs established:

  • ONGC (1956)

  • IOC (1959)

  • OIL (1959)

  • GAIL (1984)

- Refining capacity:

  • 1947: 0.25 MMTPA

  • 1990: 51.8 MMTPA

  • 2000: 112.5 MMTPA

5. Challenges/Limitations

- Import dependency still 80%+ (2020)

- Limited domestic reserves

- High exploration costs

- Environmental concerns

- Technology gaps

- Investment needs: $400 billion+ (estimated 2020-25)

- Global price vulnerability

- Geopolitical risks

Key Statistics (2020):

- Oil consumption: 4.5 million barrels/day

- Production: 0.8 million barrels/day

- Reserves: 4.7 billion barrels

- Refineries: 23

- Processing capacity: 249.9 MMTPA

- Investment in sector: $118 billion (2000-2020)
