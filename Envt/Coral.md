1. symbiotic relationship
	1. Zooxenthalae -> provide coral polyps with food, color, and help build their CaCO3 skeleton
	2. coral polyps -> provide zooxenthallea with - 
		1. CO2, and waste products(mainly nitrogen) -> essential for algae's photosynthesis
		2. stable habitat and access to sunlight
		3. protected envt  within their tissues.
2. types of reef
	1. Fringing reef - on the shore
	2. barrier reef -> separated(from the shore) by a lagoon
	3. atoll reef -> around sunkun volcanic islands, ring shaped, lagoon in center.
### coral Bleaching
1. due to climatic conditions... if zooxenthallea is no more able to produce food, coral polyps expel them -> turning white - k/a coral bleaching
2. impacts - 
	1. death to both organisms
	2. discoloration
3. reasons -
	1. increased temp. , ideal(23-29)
	2. polluted water -> lack of enough sunlight
	3. imbalance in nutrients
4. Herbivores like parrotfish and sea turtles are necessary for grazing on them(ideally...)
5. Mass coral bleaching events - 
	1. Ningaloo reef(Aus) in recent yrs
	2. Great barrier reef(AUS)
