### context
1. SC -> Replenishment data is a prerequisite for environmental clearance along with DSR.
2. without Replenishment data , DSR is defective
### Replenishment data -
1. refers to the data about the replenishment of the resource that is going to be exploited.
2. ex - Trees regrow before felling..., sand recharge.. for sand mining.. etc

### Deepak Kumar vs State of haryana case 2012
SC said unrestricted sand mining causes widespread environmental degradation including..
1. loss of fish breeding ground, -> biodiversity loss
2. depletion in ground water levels
	1. seasonal rivers -> silt hold water ->  recharges ground water.
	2. river bed lower than ground water levels -> act as drain
3. riverbank erosion -> habitat loss
4. increased risks of floods ->  due to unstable riverbed. -> river eating its own flood-plain...


### Legal Framework
1. Envt Protection Act 1986 -
2. Deepak Kumar vs State of haryana case 2012 SC verdict
	1. mandated environment clearance for all minor mineral extraction
3. EIA(Envt Impact Assessment) Notification 2016
	1. introduced cluster based assessment
	2. Replenishment study a key part of DSR
	3. Sustainable sand mining Management Guidelines 2016 -
		1. mandates the calculation of Annual Replenishment rate to determine safe, and sustainable mining limits
4.
