1. started in 2003
2. Min of Patroleum and natural gas
3. 10% by 2022
4. Target -> 20% blend by 2025-26 -> preponed from initial target 2030.
5. saved 1.4 lakh crore in foreign exchange and reduced GHG
6. feedstock diversification ->
	1. 2022-23 -> 0% by maize
	2. 2025 -> 42% by maize

### Concerns
1. ethanol can degrade rubber, plastic and metals -> older engines -> Leakages and corrosion
2. ethanol -> absorbs water, phase separation -> clogging, fuel system failures
3. EBP -> older systems may not manage air-fuel ratio adequetly -> drivability and emission risks...
4. if engine and materials are not suited specifically to EBP -> high release of NOx and aldehyde.
5.
