1. computing using qubits(quantum bits) instead of classical bits
2. works on quantum mechanics not classical physics
3. proposed by richard feymann in 1981
4. advantage - 
	1. qubits can remain in 0 and 1 simultaneously (superposition), -> parallel computing
	2. entanglement - qubits in quantum entanglement maintain relative value(state of one instantly affect another), no matter how far they are,
	3. processing power(speed) -> enormously high than existing super computers
5. application - 
	1. drug discovery - Pfizer+IBM
	2. quantum cryptography
	3. encryption and decyption
	4. mineral detection, medical imaging
	5. logistics management
6. Progress so far - 
	1. Google, IBM and china's Jiuzhang - 100 qubits Q.C developed..
	2. google - sycamore - 200 seconds operation(q .C.) vs 10,000 yrs(super computer)
	3. jiuzhang- photonic qubits
7. challenges - 
	1. Decoherence - qubits unstable in atm( 10^-4 seconds), destroyed in envtal noise
	2. require ultra cold temp, sophisticated systems and quantum labs
	3. for one reliable logical qubit, multiple qubits are required(100 -> 4-5 reliable qubits)
8. global funding  - 
	1. top 5 - china > USA > EU .> {UK + japan + canada} > India
9. India - [[National Quantum Mission]]
