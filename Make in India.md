## 1. Started - 2014

## 2. Nodal Ministry
Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India

## 3. Goal
To transform India into a global manufacturing hub by encouraging domestic manufacturing, reducing import dependence, and boosting economic growth and job creation.

## 4. Aim
* To increase the manufacturing sector's contribution to India's GDP to 25% by 2025 (revised target).
* To attract foreign direct investment (FDI) into the manufacturing sector.
* To promote innovation, skill development, and intellectual property rights.
* To enhance India's competitiveness in the global market.
* To create a robust manufacturing ecosystem, including infrastructure and supply chains.
* To generate significant employment opportunities, particularly for the youth.
* To foster the growth of strategic sectors and reduce reliance on imports.

## 5. Initiatives (or Key Features)
* **Focus Sectors:** Initially identified 25 key sectors, later expanded to include more, such as automobiles, aviation, chemicals, defence manufacturing, electronic systems, food processing, pharmaceuticals, renewable energy, textiles, and tourism.
* **Policy Reforms:** Implementation of various policy measures to ease the cost of doing business, simplify regulations, and create a favorable investment climate.
* **FDI Promotion:** Relaxing FDI norms in several sectors to attract foreign investment.
* **Infrastructure Development:** Investing in infrastructure projects, including industrial corridors, smart cities, and logistics parks, to support manufacturing activities.
* **Ease of Doing Business:** Initiatives to streamline processes, reduce bureaucratic hurdles, and improve the overall business environment.
* **Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Protection:** Strengthening the IPR regime to encourage innovation and creativity.
* **Skill Development:** Launching skill development programs to create a skilled workforce for the manufacturing sector.
* **National Manufacturing Policy:** Providing a strategic framework for the growth of the manufacturing sector.
* **Public Procurement Preference:** Giving preference to domestically manufactured goods in government procurement.
* **"Zero Defect Zero Effect" (ZED) Scheme:** Promoting quality and environmental consciousness in manufacturing.
* **Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Schemes:** Offering financial incentives to boost domestic manufacturing in key sectors like electronics, pharmaceuticals, telecom, and automobiles.
* **PM GatiShakti National Master Plan:** An integrated approach to plan and implement infrastructure projects, enhancing multi-modal connectivity for economic growth.

## 6. Achievements (if any)
* Significant increase(119% compare to last decade) in FDI inflow into India.
* Growth in domestic manufacturing capacity in several sectors, particularly electronics(mobile imports decreased by 84% across the decade) and renewable energy.
* Increased focus on local sourcing and reduction in import dependence in some areas.
* Improvement in India's ranking in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business index.(142nd -> 63rd(2020))
* Launch and implementation of successful PLI schemes attracting substantial investment commitments.(FDI equity inflow -> >>69%(decadal increase))
* Development of industrial corridors and manufacturing clusters.(Approval for **12 new industrial cities** under the National Industrial Corridor Development Programme (NICDP))
* Enhanced focus on quality and standards through initiatives like the ZED scheme.

### Negatives
* **Manufacturing Sector Contribution to GDP:** The target of increasing the manufacturing sector's contribution to 25% of GDP by 2025 is unlikely to be met. The current contribution hovers around 17-18%.
* **Job Creation:** While the initiative aimed to create significant employment, the actual job creation in the manufacturing sector has been slower than anticipated.
* **Competitiveness:** Enhancing India's global competitiveness in manufacturing remains a challenge, with issues like logistics costs, infrastructure gaps, and regulatory complexities still needing significant improvement.
* **Deepening of Value Chains:** While some progress has been made, building deep and integrated domestic value chains across various sectors is still an ongoing process.
* **Skill Development Gaps:** Despite skill development programs, a significant gap remains between the skills required by the manufacturing industry and the available workforce.

## 7. Any Significant Development in Current
* Continued emphasis on the implementation and expansion of PLI schemes to cover more sectors and deepen domestic manufacturing capabilities.
* Focus on leveraging PM GatiShakti to improve logistics and reduce the cost of manufacturing.
* Ongoing efforts to further simplify regulations and improve the ease of doing business for manufacturers.
* Increased attention to promoting sustainable manufacturing practices and green technologies.
* Strengthening of domestic supply chains and reducing reliance on single sources for critical components.
* Focus on promoting exports of manufactured goods to make India a global manufacturing hub.
* Active promotion of "Vocal for Local" and "Atmanirbhar Bharat" initiatives to encourage domestic consumption and production.
* As of May 2025, the government continues to actively engage with industries and stakeholders to address challenges and further boost manufacturing growth under the Make in India framework.
