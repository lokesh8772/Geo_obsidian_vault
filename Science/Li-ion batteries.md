1. high energy density(75-200 watt-hours per kg)
2. lightweight and less toxic materials(Li and carbon) vs Lead Acid batteries
3. good cycle stablity, efficiency and reliability -> less self discharge and no memory effect(slow down due to repeated charging)
## Challenges
1. china controls the production of Li (50%) and Li-ion batteries(70%)
2. Li-mining -> water intensive process(2000 tonnes / ton of Li)
3. batteries include flammable electrolyte , if mis-handled -> explosion
4.
