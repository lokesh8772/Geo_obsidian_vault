### Fission
1. U-235, or Pu-239
2. when bombarded with neutrons -> becomes unstable -> splits into lighter nuclei.
3. along with nuclei -> releases 2-3 neutrons + gamma rays
4. these neutrons can further intensify the reaction
5. in reactors -> Cd and Boron -> used as control rod for absorbing excess neutrons.

| Feature            | Nuclear Fission                                      | Nuclear Fusion                                           |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Process**        | Splitting of heavy nucleus                           | Combining of light nuclei                                |
| **Reactants**      | Heavy nuclei (e.g., U-235, Pu-239)                   | Light nuclei (e.g., H isotopes: Deuterium, Tritium)      |
| **Conditions**     | Initiated by neutron bombardment (can be controlled) | Extremely high temperature and pressure                  |
| **Energy Release** | Large (e.g., per reaction)                           | Even Larger (per unit mass)                              |
| **Byproducts**     | Radioactive fission products, neutrons               | Generally non-radioactive products, neutrons             |
| **Applications**   | Nuclear power plants, Atomic bombs                   | Sun's energy, Hydrogen bombs, Controlled fusion research |
## Concentration of Uranium for Different Purposes

|Purpose|Type of Uranium|Enrichment Level (U-235)|Concentration Details|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Nuclear Power**|Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU)|3-5% U-235|Typically used in commercial nuclear reactors. Natural uranium contains about 0.7% U-235, so it must be enriched to this level.|
|**Nuclear Weapons**|Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU)|90% or more U-235|Required for the production of nuclear weapons. This level of enrichment is significantly higher than that used for energy production.|
|**Research Reactors**|Medium-Enriched Uranium|20% U-235|Used in some research reactors for scientific purposes.|
|**Depleted Uranium**|Depleted Uranium|Less than 0.3% U-235|Used in military applications, such as armor-piercing ammunition. It is a byproduct of the enrichment process.|
