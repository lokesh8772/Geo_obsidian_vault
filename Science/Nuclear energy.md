### Fission
1. U-235, or Pu-239
2. when bombarded with neutrons -> becomes unstable -> splits into lighter nuclei.
3. along with nuclei -> releases 2-3 neutrons + gamma rays
4. these neutrons can further intensify the reaction
5. in reactors -> Cd and Boron -> used as control rod for absorbing excess neutrons.
