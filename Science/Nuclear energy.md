### Fission
1. U-235, or Pu-239
2. when bombarded with neutrons -> becomes unstable -> splits into lighter nuclei.
3. along with nuclei -> releases 2-3 neutrons + gamma rays
4. these neutrons can further intensify the reaction
5. in reactors -> Cd and Boron -> used as control rod for absorbing excess neutrons.

| Feature            | Nuclear Fission                                      | Nuclear Fusion                                           |

| **Process**        | Splitting of heavy nucleus                           | Combining of light nuclei                                |
| **Reactants**      | Heavy nuclei (e.g., U-235, Pu-239)                   | Light nuclei (e.g., H isotopes: Deuterium, Tritium)      |
| **Conditions**     | Initiated by neutron bombardment (can be controlled) | Extremely high temperature and pressure                  |
| **Energy Release** | Large (e.g., per reaction)                           | Even Larger (per unit mass)                              |
| **Byproducts**     | Radioactive fission products, neutrons               | Generally non-radioactive products, neutrons             |
| **Applications**   | Nuclear power plants, Atomic bombs                   | Sun's energy, Hydrogen bombs, Controlled fusion research |
