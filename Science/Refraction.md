### Refraction laws(Snell's laws)
1. incidental angle, normal and refracted angle -> lies in the same plane
2. $\sin$ $i$ / $\sin$ $r$ = constant($n$)(refractive index of second medium w.r.t. the first medium)
3. $n_1$ sin i = $n_2$ sin r
4. $n$ = $c/v$
5. $n_2$$_1$ = $v_1 / v_2$

### TIR
1. total internal refraction
2. when light moves from denser to rarer medium(optically) -> it bends -> outward -> if angle of incident is > a critical angle (C) => light reflected back into the denser medium
3. C of diamonds - 24.4$\degree$ -> TIR very common in diamonds, for water it is 48....
#### applications
1. optical fibers
2. Prisms in binoculars and periscopes(view of obstructed place) -> lesser loss of light compared to mirrors -> near 100% reflection by mirrors + reduction in overall length of the instrument.
