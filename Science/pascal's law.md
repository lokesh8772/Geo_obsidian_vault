when a pressure is applied to a fluid(non-compressible , static in a closed system) -> it gets distributed to each point in the liquid. in all directions, including the walls. 

Note 
in case of compressible fluids the reaction time will be there, but in case of non-compressible ones -> the pressure gets distributed instantly...

### applications
1. hydraulic press., systemss..
