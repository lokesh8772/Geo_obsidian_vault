isolated poles does not exist
### magnetic materials
1. ferromagnetic -> strongly attracted to the magnets and easily magnetized, demagnetized -> Fe, Ni, Co
2. paramagnetic -> weakly attracted to the magnets -> Al, Pt
3. diamagnetic -> weakly repelled to the magnets-> water, copper, gold, silver
magnetic field lines originate at North pole -> ...

### Earth
1. magnetic north pole -> geographical south pole ... ke paas and vice versa -> that's why a suspended magnet's north pole -> points to the geo. north of the earth.
2. magnetic axis tilted at 11 - 15$\degree$ to the geo. axis
