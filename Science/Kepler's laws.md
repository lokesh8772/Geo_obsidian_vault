### first law -> ellipses
it stated that the orbit of the planets are elliptical in shape with sun at on of its foci

### second law -> Area sweep
it stated that for a planet orbiting the sun, the line joining the planet and the sun sweeps equal area in equal time no matter what is the position of the planet in its orbit.
1. planets when nearer to the sun(in their orbit) have greater speeds.
2. **only applicable for a single planet** -> not to be confused like outer planets will have lesser speeds than inner ones -> **although it is true** -> but due to third law of kepler.(can be understood by replacing a -> r for simplicity)

### thrid law -> Time periods
it stated that the time periods(of complete orbit) of a planet is related to the semi major axis(a) of the orbit in following manner
\[$T^2 / a^3$ = constant.] => for **every planet** -
1. farther planets take longer durations to complete their orbit
2.
