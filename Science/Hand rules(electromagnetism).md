### Right hand thumb rule
for determining the direction of the magnetic field around a current carrying wire.

### Flehmings' left hand rule
for determining the direction of the force that a current carrying conductor experience when placed in a magnetic field.
1. thumb -> direction of force
2. forefinger -> direction of current
3. middlefinger -> direction of magnetic field

### Flehmings' right hand rule
for determining the direction of induced current when a conductor is moved in a magnetic field.
1. thumb -> motion
2. fore finger -> magnetic field
3. middle finger -> induced current.
