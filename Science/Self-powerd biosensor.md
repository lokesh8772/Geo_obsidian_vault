1. scientists turned E-coli bacteria into a self powered biosensor
2. biosensor -> biological activity/signal -> detectable electronic signal
3. earlier used enzymes -> costly, more response time, fragile....
4. Whole-cell biosensor -
	1. include micro-organisms that can maintain and repair themselves and operate in contaminated envt.
5. applications -
	1. pollution detection in agriculture
	2. envtal and biological diagnostics
	3.
