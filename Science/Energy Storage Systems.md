1. Mechanical -> pumped hydro energy systems -> energy as potential energy of water., Compressed air system
2. Electro-Chemical -> Li-ion batteries, high temperature sodium batteries, Lead-acid batteries, zinc based batteries, Flow batteries
3. Thermal -> uses materials to store excess thermal energy, -> molten salt, hot/chilled water, ice storage.
4. Electrical -> Super capacitors, Superconducting magnetic energy storage. -> high power short bursts
5. Chemical -> use electricity to produce Hydrogen, which can be used to produce energy as a fuel.

India's needs
1. 61GW by 2030
2. 97 GW by 2032
3. currently we have only 6GW
