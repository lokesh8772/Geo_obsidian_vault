### pitch, loudness, quality
1. pitch -> frequency,
2. loudness ->amplitude
3. quality -> number , relative intensity and  combinations of overtones present along with fundamental frequency of the instrument. -> actual waveform is not completely sinosudal.
### speed of sound
dependent on Elasticity constant (bulk modulus for fluids and young for solids)
$v \propto \sqrt{E/\rho}$
1. solids -> fastest -> 5k -6k m/s(due to high elasticity)
2. liquids - > faster -> 1.49k m/s
3. gases -> least -> 343 m/s
4. effect of temprature for gases
	1. increases by 0.61$\Delta$T
#### things that does not affect
1. frequency and wavelegth of soundwaves -> $v = \lambda\nu$
2. any change in frequency -> wavelength is adjusted to keep the velocity constant
3. ampltitude.
4. pressure -> while it should increase, -> increase in the kinetic energy but the density is also increased so, they cancel out each other.
### echo
1. hearing of a repetitive sound due to reflection by a distant object
2. minimum distance of the obstacle - >17.15 m.(air)
3. humans can distinguish sound at the resolution of 0.1 seconds
### reverbrations
1. persistant stay of the sound in a large auditorium due to continuous reflection from different directions -> cause the sound to be muddy or unclear
2. rough surfaces to reduce the reflections
3. time gap of reflections  < 0.1 sec.
4.
