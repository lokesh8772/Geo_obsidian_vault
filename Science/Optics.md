### convex mirror -
object b/w infinity and pole -> image b/w F and Pole, -> erect, virtusal, diminished

|Object Position|Image Position|Nature|Size|
|---|---|---|---|
|At Infinity|At F (behind mirror)|Virtual, Erect|Highly Diminished|
|Anywhere between Pole and Infinity|Between P and F (behind mirror)|Virtual, Erect|Diminished|

### concave mirror

| Object Position | Image Position              | Nature         | Size              | Use/Application (Conceptual)                        |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| At Infinity     | At F                        | Real, Inverted | Highly Diminished | Reflecting telescopes, solar furnaces               |
| Beyond C        | Between F and C             | Real, Inverted | Diminished        |                                                     |
| At C            | At C                        | Real, Inverted | Same Size         |                                                     |
| Between C and F | Beyond C                    | Real, Inverted | Enlarged          |                                                     |
| At F            | At Infinity                 | Real, Inverted | Highly Enlarged   | Headlights (bulb at F, rays go to infinity)         |
| Between F and P | Behind the mirror (Virtual) | Virtual, Erect | Enlarged          | Shaving mirrors, dentist's mirrors, make-up mirrors |

### mirror formula 
$1/f = 1/v + 1/u$

### lens formula
$1/f = 1/v - 1/u$

#### magnification
m = height of image/ height of object = $h_i / h_o$ = $v/u$
if m is positive -> image is erect -> imaginary. and vice versa
