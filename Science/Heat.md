### Transfer 
1. conduction
2. convection
3. radiation
dark objects are good absorbers and good emitters too. -> radiation
for lighter or lustrous objects it is vice versa

### Expansion
#### solids
1. $\Delta$$L$ = $\alpha$$L_0$$\Delta$T
2. $\Delta$$A$ = $\beta$$A_0$$\Delta$T  (for isotropics - $\beta$ = 2$\alpha$)
3. $\Delta$$V$ = $\gamma$$V_0$$\Delta$T  (for isotrpics => $\gamma$ = 3$\alpha$)
4. isotropic -> uniform in all direction
#### liquids
1. expansion more than solids
2. water -> at 4$\degree$C -> maximum density -> further cooling -> expands -> survival of aquatic species in winters -> as the warmer water(at 4$\degree$C) resides in the bottom -> upper layer => ice -> acts like insulator -> prevent further freezing.

#### gases 
1. they do not have a fixed volume
2. when heated they expand more than liquids
3. $\gamma$$_G$ $\approx$ $1/T$ (for ideal gases)
4. hence the $\gamma$ for gases is not a fixed value like solids or liquids -> it depends upon the initial temp.
