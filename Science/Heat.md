### Transfer 
1. conduction
2. convection
3. radiation
dark objects are good absorbers and good emitters too. -> radiation
for lighter or lustrous objects it is vice versa

### Expansion
#### solids
1. $\Delta$$L$ = $\alpha$$L_0$$\Delta$T
2. $\Delta$$A$ = $\beta$$A_0$$\Delta$T  (for isotropics - $\beta$ = 2$\alpha$)
3. $\Delta$$L$ = $\gamma$$V_0$$\Delta$T  (for isotrpics => $\gama)
