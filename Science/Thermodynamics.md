### zeroth law
if two systems are in thermal equlibrium with a third system -> then they are thermal equilibrium with each other

### first law
1. Energy can neither be created or destroyed , it is transformed from one form to another

### second law
1. Entropy of an isolated system can either be increased or be constant(ideal case(reversible)) but can not be decreased.
2. no engine can achieve 100% efficiency, some amount of energy is bound to be lost as heat...
3. heat can not be transferred(spontaneous) from a colder body -> hotter body unless there is external work done

### third law
1. entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero temp. is zero.
#### applications
1. absolute 0K is practically impossible
2. cryogenics
3. superconductors
4. quantum computers -> require cryogenic temp. -> third law
5. refrigeration limits -> 2nd law -> 0K not possible, -> 3rd law -> not possible in finite steps.
