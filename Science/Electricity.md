### Joule's law
heat generated is proportional to 
1. square of the current
2. resistance
3. time
### nichrome 
1. used in heaters
2. high resistance
3. high melting point
4. do not oxidize even when red hot

### magnetism
1. in a solenoid -
	1. more concentrated turns produce more current.
	2. core -> ferromagnetic material -> more magnetism than air core.
	3.
