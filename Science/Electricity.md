### Joule's law
heat generated is proportional to 
1. square of the current
2. resistance
3. time
### nichrome 
1. used in heaters
2. high resistance
3. high melting point
4. do not oxidize even when red hot

### AC current
1. its direction and amplitude both changes periodically
2. easier to produce
3. in india standard frequency is 50 Hz
4. Easy voltage transformation -> EMI

### magnetism
1. in a solenoid -
	1. more concentrated turns produce more current.
	2. core -> ferromagnetic material -> more magnetism than air core.
[[Hand rules(electromagnetism)]]
motor -> flehming's left hand rule.

### faradey's law
an emf is induced in a region of varying magnetic field

direction -> Lenz' law -> direction of the induced current(in conductor) always oppose the change.

this is called EMI

applications
1. Transformer.
	1. $N_p > N_s -> V_p > V_s$
2. Generator.
3.
