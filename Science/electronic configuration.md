### orbitals -
3d space in a shell where the probabilty of finding an electron is highest.
s -> 1 orbital
p -> 3 
d -> 5
f -> 7

### Aufbau principal-
1. electrons will occupy the orbital of least energy
2. energy determined by (n+l) rule , n -> principle quantum number , $l$ -> azimuthal quantum number. if equal -> lesser  n is filled

### pauli's exclusion
1. no two electrons can have all the four quantom numbers identicle in a an atom
2. any orbital can have max 2 electrons 
### Hund's max multiplicity
1. in case of same energy -> electrons are filled in each orbital singlly-> once completed in all orbitals of a shell -> paired.

### quantum numbers
1. principal quantum number ($n$)=> the main energy shell
2. azimuthal ($l$) -> determines the shape of the orbital
	1. s -> 0
	2. p -> 1
	3. d -> 2
	4. f -> 3
3. magnetic quantum number ($m_l$) 
	1. orientation of an orbital in space relative to external magnetic field
	2. from $-l$ to $+l$ including 0
4. Spin quantum number($m_s$)
	1. two values -> -1/2, +1/2
