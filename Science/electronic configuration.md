### orbitals -
3d space in a shell where the probabilty of finding an electron is highest.
s -> 1 orbital
p -> 3 
d -> 5
f -> 7

### Aufbau principal-
1. electrons will occupy the orbital of least energy
2. energy determined by (n+l) rule , n -> principle quantum number , $l$ -> azimuthal quantum number.

### pauli's exclusion
1. no two electrons can have all the four quantom numbers identicle in a an atom
2. any orbital can have max 2
