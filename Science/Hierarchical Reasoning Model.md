contrary to most LLMs in market like GPT which use chain-of-thought processing, 
1. modellled on Human brain's Hierarchical, multi-time scale processing
2. mimics how different parts of human brain integrate information across durations.
3. HRM does sequential reasoning tasks in single forward pass, without explicit supervision of intermediate process.
4. uses two level modules
	1. high level modules -> slow, abstract thinking
	2. low level modules -> fast, calculations
