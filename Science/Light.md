### wave
1. young's double slit experiment
2. evidences -
	1. interference -> when two light waves meets -> they have constructive and destructive interference(brighter and darker strips)
	2. diffraction -> bending of light when passing from narrow spaces
	3. refraction -> bending of light when changing medium(change in speed)
	4. reflection -> bounce-back 

### particle -
1. issac newton
2. max planc
3. albert einstein
4. evidence - 
	1. photo - electric effect

light behaves like particle or wave based on the measurement technique -> qu
