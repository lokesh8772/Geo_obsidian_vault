### Technology Development Fund (TDF) Scheme

#### 1. Launch Date
*   **September 2016**.

#### 2. Ministry/Nodal Agency
*   **Ministry of Defence**.
*   Executed by the **Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)**.

#### 3. Objective
*   Promote **self-reliance** in defence technology as part of the [[Make In India]] initiative.
*   Fund the development of components, products, systems, and technologies that are currently not available with the Indian defence industry.
*   Encourage the participation of public/private industries, especially MSMEs and startups, to create an ecosystem for cutting-edge technology.
*   Develop **defence and dual-use technologies**.

#### 4. Key Beneficiaries
*   Public and private industries, with a special focus on **MSMEs and Startups**.
*   Academia and research institutions (in collaboration with industry).

#### 5. Features
*   **Funding Model:** A grant-in-aid scheme where DRDO funds up to **90%** of the project cost. The industry partner contributes the remaining 10%.
*   **Funding Limit:** The project cost for funding was initially up to ₹10 crore, which was later enhanced to **₹50 crore**.
*   **Project Duration:** Typically, projects are expected to be completed within a development period of two years.
*   **IPR:** The Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) are jointly held by the DRDO and the developing industry.
*   **Procurement Preference:** Successful products are considered under the **(Buy-Indian) IDDM** (Indigenously Designed, Developed and Manufactured) category, giving them preference in procurement.

#### 6. Achievements
*   As of December 2023, a total of **70 projects** at a cost of ₹291.25 crore have been sanctioned.
*   **16 defence technologies** have been successfully developed and realized under the scheme.

#### 7. Related Government Schemes
*   [[iDEX]]
*   [[Defence India Start-up Challenge (DISC)]]
*   [[Make In India]]

#### 8. Shortcomings/Criticisms
*   No specific, major criticisms are widely documented. The scheme is generally seen as a key enabler.
*   Potential challenges, inherent to such schemes, could include bureaucratic delays or the complex technical evaluation process for project selection.

#### 9. Way Forward
*   Continue to identify and fund technology gap areas in deep tech, cyber domains, AI, quantum computing, and other critical fields.
*   Strengthen collaboration with industry and academia, including through the **15 DRDO Industry Academia Centres of Excellence (DIA-CoEs)** established across the country.
*   Absorb genuine failures during the development process to encourage risk-taking and innovation.

#### 10. Recent Updates
*   **Funding Enhancement (2022):** The funding limit per project was significantly increased from ₹10 crore to ₹50 crore to support more ambitious and high-cost technology development.
*   **NIIO MoU (October 2022):** The Naval Innovation and Indigenisation Organisation (NIIO) signed an MoU with TDF to focus on the indigenization of naval sub-systems.
