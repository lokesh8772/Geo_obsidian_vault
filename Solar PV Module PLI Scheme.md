Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), Government of India

## 3. Goal
To build up solar PV manufacturing capacity of high-efficiency modules in India and reduce import dependence in the area of Renewable Energy.

## 4. Aim
* To achieve manufacturing capacity of Giga Watt (GW) scale in High Efficiency Solar PV modules.
* To bring cutting-edge technology to India for manufacturing high-efficiency modules.
* To promote setting up of integrated plants for better quality control and competitiveness.
* To develop an ecosystem for sourcing local material in solar manufacturing.
* To generate employment and achieve technological self-sufficiency.
* To encourage sustainable manufacturing practices and adoption of circular economy approaches.

## 5. Initiatives (or Key Features)
* **Production Linked Incentive (PLI):** Financial incentives are provided to selected solar PV module manufacturers for five years post-commissioning, based on the manufacture and sale of high-efficiency solar PV modules.
* **Tranche-I (Outlay ₹4,500 crore):** Focus on setting up fully integrated solar PV module manufacturing units. Letters of Award were issued to three successful bidders for 8,737 MW capacity. Implementing agency: Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited (IREDA).
* **Tranche-II (Outlay ₹19,500 crore):** Focus on setting up fully/partially integrated solar PV module manufacturing units. Letters of Award were issued to 11 bidders for 39,600 MW capacity. Implementing agency: Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI).
* **Technology Agnostic:** The scheme allows all technologies, but incentivizes those yielding better module performance.
* **Domestic Content Requirement (DCR):** Some MNRE schemes mandate the sourcing of solar PV cells and modules from domestic sources.
* **Preference to 'Make in India':** Government procurement mandates the use of domestically manufactured solar PV modules and inverters.
* **Basic Customs Duty (BCD):** Imposition of BCD on the import of solar PV cells and modules to encourage domestic manufacturing.
* **Financial Outlay:** A total outlay of ₹24,000 crore for both tranches of the scheme.
* **Job Creation:** Expected to generate significant direct and indirect employment.
* **Investment:** Tranche-II alone is expected to bring in an investment of over ₹93,000 crore.

## 6. Achievements (if any)
* Under Tranche-I, Letters of Award issued for setting up 8,737 MW of fully integrated solar PV module manufacturing units.
* Under Tranche-II, Letters of Award issued for setting up 39,600 MW of fully/partially integrated solar PV module manufacturing units.
* Total domestic solar PV module manufacturing capacity allocated under both tranches is 48,337 MW.
* Over ₹35,000 crore investment reported under the scheme as of October 2024.
* Around 10,000 direct jobs generated as of October 2024.
* India's solar PV module manufacturing capacity has increased significantly, reaching approximately 70 GW by February 2025.

## 7. Any Significant Development in Current
* Focus on operationalizing the capacities awarded under both tranches.
* Monitoring the progress of the selected manufacturers in setting up their units.
* Emphasis on increasing the local content in solar PV manufacturing.
* Exploring further measures to support the growth of the domestic solar manufacturing ecosystem.
* Continued efforts to reduce import dependence and make India a global hub for solar manufacturing.
* As of May 2025, the domestic solar PV module manufacturing capacity in the country, as per the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM), is around 63 GW per annum.
