# Solar PV Module PLI Scheme

## 1. Started - 2021 (Tranche-I), 2022 (Tranche-II)

## 2. Nodal Ministry
Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE)

## 3. Goal
Build high-efficiency solar PV manufacturing capacity; reduce import dependence.

## 4. Aim
* GW-scale high-efficiency solar PV module manufacturing.
* Bring cutting-edge technology to India.
* Promote integrated plants.
* Develop local sourcing ecosystem.
* Generate employment, technological self-sufficiency.
* Encourage sustainable manufacturing.

## 5. Initiatives (or Key Features)
* Production Linked Incentive (PLI) for 5 years post-commissioning.
* Tranche-I (₹4,500 crore): Fully integrated units, 8,737 MW capacity awarded.
* Tranche-II (₹19,500 crore): Fully/partially integrated units, 39,600 MW capacity awarded.
* Technology Agnostic (incentivizing better performance).
* Domestic Content Requirement (DCR) in some MNRE schemes.
* Preference to 'Make in India' in govt procurement.
* Basic Customs Duty (BCD) on imports.
* Total Outlay: ₹24,000 crore.

## 6. Achievements (if any)
* Manufacturing Capacity Awarded -> 8,737 MW (Tranche-I) + 39,600 MW (Tranche-II) = 48,337 MW.
* Investment -> ₹1.46 Lakh crore realized (across all PLI schemes by Aug 2024).
* Solar PV Module Capacity -> ~70 GW (by Feb 2025).
* Decline in Imports -> Solar cells -20%, modules -57% (first 8 months of FY 2024-25).

### Negatives
* Import Dependence -> Continues for solar PV cells and wafers.
* Project Costs -> Increased due to import duties and domestic production expenses (₹2-₹2.5/Wp increase for domestic panels estimated due to raw material costs).
* Competition from Imports -> Cheaper imports, especially from China and Vietnam, can undermine domestic manufacturers.
* Delays in Project Execution -> Impacting renewable energy rollout.

## 7. Any Significant Development in Current
* PLI Budget Increased -> Electronics & IT Hardware to ₹9,000 crore (from ₹5,777 crore RE 2024-25).
* PLI Budget Increased -> Automobiles & Auto Components to ₹2,818.85 crore (from ₹346.87 crore RE 2024-25).
