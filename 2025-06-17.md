### GDP
value of all the goods and services produced within the domestic territory of the country
#### domestic territory 
	political fontiers + territorial waters + ship + aricrafts + ambasies/consulates
### GDP gap 
GDP potential - real GDP ,(potential -> max. gdp that can be generated by available resources)
### GDP calculation
#### expenditure method
1. C+I+G+X-M
2. consumption, investment, govt expenditure + export -import
3. consumption - by private individuals...
4. investment - capital assets, house, IPR, land, raw material or intermediate....
5. Govt ex - not scholarships or cash transfer but employee salaray + other expenditure counted
#### value addition method
1. GVA - Gross value added
2. final price - intermediate prices
3. GDP = GVA + indirect taxes - subsidies
4. GVA - producer side analysis, GDP - consumer side analysis
#### discrepency
GVA method = more accurate, GDP method Not as much,
any difference b/w those is discrepency.

#### factor cost method
1. WIPR -> wages + Interest + Profit + rent
2. real life calculation = compensation(wages + Social security contribution of employer)  + operating surplus + consumption of fixed assets during production 
### GDP deflator 
(Nominal / real ) * 100
### Recession vs Depression
recession = 
1. short term low of economy,
2. evident by 2 consecutive years of negative growth rate
Depression - 
3. long term 
4. sustained negative growth rate
### Hysteresis
effects continue to exist even if the factors that initially led to the effects have vanished. Ex = less spending post COVID 
### Doom loop
one negative economic condition creates a negative effect, that in turn creates or amplifies the effect of the causing condition
### financial contagian - 
spread of financial disruptions from one economy/sector etc to another
### Goldilocks scenario
ideal condition in an economy where growth in neither too high nor too low to cause either of inflation or recession
### twin balance sheet syndrome
1. occurs when both corporate sector and banking sector face huge financial stress
2. corporate over-borrow during boom but unable to repay it due to limited or lower than expected returns
3. now in corporate sector balance sheet -> there is loss
4. in bank's balance sheet -> NPA increased -> losses
### terms
#### savings
income excess of consumption
#### investment = 
1. saving + foreign borrrowings that are used in real(physical) assets(machinery, buildings,..)
2. in open economy -> investment may be > domestic savings
3. in closed economy -> investment </= domestic savings
#### Gross fixed capital formation rate
1. investment - disposal(liquidation) of assets
2. it ignores depreciation
### capital output ratio
capital / output -> lesser the better
### VRR and FAR
1. voluntary retention route
	1. special window under atmanirbhar bharat
	2. to promote FPIs to do long term investment in indian debt markets
	3. regulatory norms relaxed
2. Fully accessible route
