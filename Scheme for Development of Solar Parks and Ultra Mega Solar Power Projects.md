## 3. Goal
To facilitate the large-scale deployment of solar power projects in the country, thereby contributing to India's energy security and promoting ecological sustainability.

## 4. Aim
* To create solar parks with necessary infrastructure to facilitate the setting up of solar power projects on a plug-and-play basis.
* To reduce the gestation period of solar projects.
* To provide a secure investment environment for project developers.
* To enhance solar power generation capacity in India.
* To attract both domestic and foreign investment in the solar sector.
* To promote economies of scale in solar power generation, leading to lower tariffs.
* To support the achievement of India's renewable energy targets and climate change commitments.

## 5. Initiatives (or Key Features)
* **Development of Solar Parks:** Providing financial support to State Governments and their agencies for the development of solar parks. This includes infrastructure such as land acquisition, road network, water arrangement, grid connectivity, security arrangements, etc.
* **Central Financial Assistance (CFA):** Initially, CFA of â‚¹25 lakh per MW or 30% of the project cost, whichever is lower, was provided for the development of solar parks. This has been revised over time.
* **Ultra Mega Solar Power Projects (UMPPs):** Facilitating the development of large-scale solar power projects, typically with capacities of 500 MW and above, within the solar parks.
* **Plug and Play Infrastructure:** Solar parks are developed with ready infrastructure, making it easier and faster for developers to set up their projects.
* **Single Window Clearance:** Efforts are made to provide single-window clearance for various approvals and permits within the solar parks.
* **Involvement of State Nodal Agencies (SNAs):** SNAs play a crucial role in the identification of land, development of infrastructure, and coordination with developers.
* **Phased Implementation:** The scheme has been implemented in phases, with targets being revised and enhanced over time.

## 6. Achievements (if any)
* As of March 31, 2024, a total of 70 Solar Parks with an aggregate capacity of over 37 GW have been approved in various States/UTs.
* Several solar parks have been successfully developed and are operational, contributing significantly to India's solar power capacity.
* Some notable operational solar parks include Bhadla Solar Park (Rajasthan), Pavagada Solar Park (Karnataka), and Rewa Ultra Mega Solar Park (Madhya Pradesh).
* The scheme has played a key role in attracting investments and driving down solar power tariffs in India.
* It has facilitated the setting up of some of the world's largest solar power projects.

## 7. Any Significant Development in Current
* Continued focus on the development of the remaining approved solar parks.
* Emphasis on ensuring timely completion of infrastructure and grid connectivity for the parks.
* Exploring the potential for hybrid solar and wind projects within the solar parks.
* Focus on enhancing the sustainability aspects of solar park development, including environmental and social considerations.
* As of May 2025, the development of solar parks is ongoing, with various states progressing at different paces. The scheme remains a crucial component of India's renewable energy strategy.
* Efforts are being made to address challenges related to land acquisition and grid infrastructure in some regions.
