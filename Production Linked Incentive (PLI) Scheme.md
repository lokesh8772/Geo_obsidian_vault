* Promote technological advancements and innovation.
* Develop robust manufacturing ecosystems.

## 5. Initiatives (or Key Features)
* Financial incentives based on incremental sales over a base year (typically 4-6% for 5-6 years).
* Scheme extended to 14 key sectors with a total outlay of ₹1.97 lakh crore (over USD 24 billion).
* Sectors include: Mobile Manufacturing & Specified Electronic Components, Pharmaceuticals, Auto & Auto Components, Telecom & Networking Products, Specialty Steel, Textiles & Apparels, Food Products, White Goods, Medical Devices, Electronics, IT Hardware, Advanced Chemistry Cell Battery, Solar PV Modules, Drones.
* Implemented through Project Management Agencies (PMAs).
