Article 163 of the Indian Constitution defines the role of the Council of Ministers in relation to the Governor in the states. Here are its key provisions:

- **Council of Ministers to Aid and Advise:** There shall be a Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister at the head to aid and advise the Governor in the exercise of his functions, except in matters where the Governor is required by or under the Constitution to act in his discretion
    
- **Governor’s Discretion:** If any question arises as to whether a matter is one in which the Governor is required to act in his discretion, the decision of the Governor in his discretion shall be final. The validity of anything done by the Governor shall not be called into question on the ground that he ought or ought not to have acted in his discretion
    
- **Non-inquiry of Advice in Court:** The question of whether any, and if so what, advice was tendered by Ministers to the Governor shall not be inquired into in any court
